This study offers minimal evidence supporting the claim that winemaking originates in Georgia. The Georgian notion lacks authenticity as it stems from an editor's creative fabrication. Scholars now believe that since Western Iran was under the influence of the Ubaid culture, leading to the Sumerian civilization, it can be viewed as an extension of Mesopotamia. Consequently, it should be included within Mesopotamia. In reality, it has been proposed that Susa was a colony of Uruk, with clear parallels in Sumerian writing development. Pottery imports and the spread of wine also indicate substantial influence. It makes no sense to disregard the influence of lowland Iran and Susa as they were integral parts of early Mesopotamia. As for any proof that winemaking didn\u2019t originate here, there isn't much evidence either. Some argue that the cultural diversity prevents Western Iran from becoming part of Sumeria, but none of these cultures, apart from Susa, exerted significant influence locally.\"\n}\n```", "top_p": 0.9, "temperature": 0.7, "time_sec": 24.884067399980268, "tokens_per_sec": 44.84797368780978}
