{"id": "190039a8-0409-55f4-bdd7-e69916ec9777", "fandoms": ["Captain America", "Constantine"], "pair": ["\"What kind of stuff?\" \"That you seemed like a nice guy, er, kind of good looking.... She also said she thought you were sweat.\" \"And you didn\"t bring us up before?\" asked Clint. \"I couldn\"t disseminate that intel until she\"d acted on it. She\"s my partner, that\"s a sacred bond.\" This time Steve grumbled. \"So did you loose interest?\" \"No... I\"d still like to take her out. I mean, if she asked me out again...\" \"Don\"t push your luck, Steve.\" \"I can\"t ask her out now, can I?\" \"Sure you can.\" Clint said, \"You\"re just going to look really stupid.\" \"So I can\"t fix this?\" \"Well, no need to be alarmed. It\"s possible. You just need to wait.\" Clint said, \"Give it two or three weeks.\" \"Alright.\" \"Then you find her again.\" Sam said, \"Act all vulnerable and hopeful and stuff. Tell her you\"ve been thinking about her, and that you\"ve decided its time to move on, embrace this bold new age with all its wonder. And British girls.\" \"I don\"t like lying to people I like, Sam.\" \"It\"s the name of the game, Cap.\" Clint said, \"Welcome to postmodern dating.\" Sharon and Natasha\"s was an odd friendship, but then any friendship that involved Natasha Romanoff was destined to be odd. Ever since Sharon moved to the states a little over a year ago, she and Natasha just seemed to click. They were raised somewhere else, they shared many of the same interests, and Sharon was a quite capable sparring partner. At an upscale Manhattan coffee bar, they sat by the window, overlooking a section of the city being rebuilt after having been decimated by Loki\"s forces months ago. They\"d already talked about politics, the economy, and had finally moved to the subject of men. \"You asked him out?\" Natasha asked, a shadow of a smile fluttering on her corner of her mouth as she somehow reclined in what was a decidedly uncomfortable chair, one of of the type only coffee bars seemed to have, \"Really?\" \"Yes.\" Sharon said, annoyed at Natasha\"s impending smugness. \"You know he grew up in the forties, right? From his perspective, it was the forties last year.\" \"I know.\" \"Carter, women didn\"t ask men out in the forties.\" \"I know that. I just thought he\"d be the open-minded, progressive sort. He had Asian and African-American members in his unit, after all.\" \"They were men, though. Race, religion, that stuff only matters later in life which is why it\"s easier to ignore. Gender roles are more ingrained.\" \"Stick to breaking people\"s necks with your thighs, darling. Leave psychology to me.\" \"You know I\"m right.\" As much as she disliked admitting it, Sharon did know Natasha was right. \"You know, he\"s probably really not dating yet.\" Natasha said before taking a bite of her croissant. \"That\"s not it.\" Sharon said. \"Of course it isn\"t, doesn\"t mean it isn\"t true. I work with him, he doesn\"t flirt or anything. He\"s the Anti-Stark. Do you know Kate Neville?\" \"No.\" \"She was the Agent that Colonel Fury got involved in the plan to have Cap think it was still 1945. She tried her luck, but he didn\"t give her the time of day. He too busy brooding.\" \"God, he must be feeling terrible.\" \"No, he\"s mostly alright. He hangs out with Clint, Sam and their friends. He\"s pretty good company, actually. Just.... Not very good with girls. And come to think of it, I\"m not sure he likes girls.\" \"You are joking.\" Sharon said with a chuckle. \"I\"m not sure. You know how there was a rumor that he dated a girl in the SSR during the war, who ended up becoming a huge movie star in the fifties?\" \"Yeah, Lorraine Palmer.\" \"Well, you were at Clint\"s movie night a couple months ago, right? Rogers denied he was ever involved with her.\" \"Well, that doesn\"t mean he\"s gay!\" \"Well when someone asked him why he didn\"t date Lorraine Palmer, it sounded like he was hiding something.... I\"m probably wrong.\" \"I also think you\"re wrong.\" Sharon said and took a sip of her coffee, \"Would be interesting, though.\" \"It would, wouldn\"t it?\" \"It\"d explain why there\"s always someone dressed as him at gay pride parades, too. But I\"ve got to ask, did you ever...?\" \"Hm?\" sounded Natasha before she caught on, \"Oh. He\"s not my type.\" \"Really?\" \"He\"s good looking, I can\"t deny that, but he\"s not my type. My first boyfriend had a bionic arm and no name, I like my men considerably damaged.\" \"Barton isn\"t damaged.\" \"Clint\"s brain damaged.\" Per Sam and Clint\"s advice, Steve waited. It wasn\"t too hard, three days after the night at McBride\"s he dispatched to SHIELD\"s India desk to assist on an operation and foster relations. At first they made their displeasure knows, as they\"d hopes to get, but after the operation was a success, all was well. And so, two weeks later, he was back in New York City. This time he didn\"t plan any coincidences. He went from LaGuardia Airport to SHIELD HQ, still totting his bag with him. He found Sharon at a corner of the commissary, helping herself to a bowl of noodles. He approached her nervously, clearing his throat as he neared her. \"Captain Rogers.\" She greeted him, \"How was India?\" \"It was good.\" He answered, unintentionally short-toned, \"Is this seat taken?\" \"No, help yourself.\" \"Thanks.\" He sat down, setting his bag on the floor, and looked at her quietly for perhaps a few seconds too long. \"How\"s it going?\" he finally asked. \"Alright. I was a bit swamped with work. You\"ve come back at a very good time; Sam\"s been driving me crazy.\" \"Is he around?\" \"He\"s left already. You can give him a call, he hadn\"t enough time to get home.\" \"No, it\"s alright. I\"ll call him tomorrow. Erm, listen... Would you like to go out with me?\" \"Uh, like on a date?\" \"Yeah.\" \"I thought you weren\"t dating?\" \"I thought I\"d start.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Yeah, why wouldn\"t I be sure?\" \"Just wondering.\" She said with a shrug, \"Sure. What did you have on mind?\" \"Um, I didn\"t really have anything in mind. Probably dinner?\" \"Well, dinner sounds appealing.\" \"Great. How about Sunday night, around eight?\" \"It sounds good.\" She said with a smile, \"I look forward to it.\" \"Great.\" He said with some awkward giddiness. Smiling, he got up, bidding her a good night as he left the commissary, forgetting his bag. Sunday - 11:41 PM Sam was beyond exhausted. He\"d just come off a thirty-six hour shift that saw him reach the culmination of a month long covert investigation into the Roxxon Energy corporation. It was passed up the ladder, now, into Coulson\"s hands. As always, there was no celebration, just the anticipation of the next assignment. At most, he\"d have liked a beer and a little company, but Clint was on assignment in god-knew-where, while Steve was on his date was Sharon, so he decided on burgers at a greasy spoon sort of all-night place down the street from his apartment. His coke was warm, his fries were soggy, the burger was a tasteless excuse of a meat patty and questionable cheese pressed between two pieces of stale bread; it was an achievement in culinary wanting, eating it was an odd sort of masochistic, macho pleasure. As he was masticating on his paltry meal, the last thing he expected to see was Steve Rogers. Nevertheless, the man grabbed his attention by knocking on the glass from outside the street before proceeding to the door. He was wearing a black suit jacket and pants and a blue shirt, which was more unbuttoned than usual, not to mention crumpled. His hair was mussed, and there were various subtle sign that Steve had been in a physical altercation. Steve slumped down into the seat across the table from Sam. He didn\"t say a word. \"That bad, huh?\" Sam asked before he spat out a tiny shard of bone. Tune in next time to find out what happened on Steve\"s date, and if and how he plans to proceed with Sharon. R&R Carling\"s Diner, while a terrible place to get a burger, was capable of providing an excellent cup of coffee. Learning of Captain America\"s romantic woes, Sam had decided to put off his much deserved rest, and gulped down the hot liquid as Steve simply nursed his own mug. \"I think I was overdressed.\" Steve mumbled. \"Did you button up your jacket?\" Steve nodded his head to the affirmative. \"Yeah, that is overdressed. So, you showed up in a buttoned-up two-piece. Is that what ruined your evening?\" Steve looked down into his mug and ran the tip of his finger on the edge. \"No.\" \"Hhh. Alright, talk me through it.\" \"Well, I took her to this place called Apollonia\"s. You know it?\" \"Yeah. Didn\"t think it was your scene.\" \"It\"s alright. I had dinner there with a reporter from Vanity Fair a few months ago.\" \"Right. So what happened?\" Earlier Steve wasn\"t as nervous as he thought he would be; which was to say he wasn\"t gnawing on his finger nails at the moment. He\"d picked Sharon up at her place. She wore jeans and a black sweater over a maroon shirt. She looked casual, yet classy, and he suddenly felt overly stuffy in the suit and tie he wore. Now at Appollonia\"s, a trendy Italian place, he thought that it was going pretty well so far. The day after he\"d asked Sharon out, he went to Philadelphia on one of his regular visits to Gabe Jones. Gabe and his live-in nurse Noreen were kindly enough to put their knowledge of the past and the present together to think of quite a few pointers on social faux-pas to avoid, stuff like not ordering his date\"s meal on her behalf, as what little he knew about dating probably belonged to the forties. He\"d managed to avoid them all. Now all he had to fill the time until the food arrived and not make an ass out of himself. He just hoped Sharon was the talkative type, as it would take plenty of pressure off of him if she was. \"So how did you end up joining SHIELD?\" he asked. That\"s always a conversation start, and he was actually curious. \"I sort of fell into it, I suppose.\" She began, \"I went to university with a vague idea that I wanted to be a writer, so I studied literature, but that lasted a mere semester. I switched majors a bit and graduated with a degree in psychology. I didn\"t know what I wanted to do with my life, so after a period of loitering, I decided to join the police service. \"I did fairly well at training. A few weeks before graduating I was introduced by my supervisor to the head of the Britain station of SHIELD, Commander Hart. His people liked my profile and Hardy offered me a job, and I accepted. I put in the leg work and moved here around a year ago.\" \"Wow. That\"s...\" \"I know, not much of a story, is it?\" she laughed, \"Good thing I didn\"t end up being a writer.\" \"Not, it\"s amazing.\" He said with sincerity, \"Are you saying you were almost a cop?\" \"Almost. I decided that the prospect of traveling the world more exciting than pounding a beat around Fenchurch. Of course I didn\"t know I would start out with assignments to places like Madripoor.\" \"Well, it\"s not what I expected.\" \"What did you expect?\" \"I don\"t know. I thought you were a legacy.\" \"A legacy?\" \"Yeah. I thought your folks might\"ve worked at SHIELD. Lots of soldiers and secret agent types get in that way, or at least they did in my day.\" \"Did you?\" \"Well,\" Steve said, considering, \"My dad was a soldier, but... No. I guess I didn\"t. I meant no offense, ayway.\" \"None taken.\" Sharon said, \"I\"ve got family who\"d served in the military or intelligence, but none in SHIELD. No, my parents were barristers.\" \"What do they think about what you do?\" Steve asked, and for a second was proud at how well he thought he was doing. If Bucky and the boys could see him now. \"Not much. They died when I was four.... Airplane crash.\" \"Oh, god. I\"m sorry.\" \"It\"s alright.\" \"What happened then?\" Steve asked cautiously. \"I went to live with my father\"s cousin Jackie. She and her partner practically raised me from then on.\" And so, with the mention of Jacqueline Falsworth, it all started to get rocky. It\"s funny, he never met the woman, nor did he even know what she looked like, and he only knew what he\"d learned through Gabe; she\"s Peggy and Jim Falsworth\"s daughter, their eldest of two. Her mention caused much of the doubts he had about his fledgling love life to resurface. Not only was he dating Peggy\"s near-identical lookalike, he was dating the one that\"d been raised her own daughter. It all seemed so terribly Grecian. Such thoughts that he was trying to find a surrogate for Peggy had occurred to him before, and Gabe, who\"s judgment he trusted, had said it was just anxiety. On his calmer states, Steve himself realized that he didn\"t long for the courtship with Peggy that could\"ve been; Peggy had a long, full life with Falsworth. Steve was happy for them both, and his interests at present were geared toward Sharon herself. But that wasn\"t the real problem, it was whether he should tell her of the feelings he once had for Peggy, and how soon. The immediate problem, of course, was that as he was having these thoughts, the conversation had stalled and the awkward silence had got to Sharon. \"But enough about me.\" Sharon said, \"Tell me something about yourself.\" \"Huh?\" Steve sounded, taken off-guard, \"Like what?\" \"Well, what did you joined the Army?\" \"Nothing.\" \"Nothing?\" \"Yeah... Pretty much. After high school, I had a string of jobs, nothing interesting or permanent.\" \"Like what?\" \"This and that.\" \"An example?\" \"Hanging wallpaper.\" \"Didn\"t you paint?\" she asked, somewhat exasperatedly. \"No. I remember the money was better, but the fumes were too much for my health.\" \"What? No. I didn\"t mean... I meant paint artistically.\" \"Oh. Oh! Yeah, I did that.... Yeah.\" And then he didn\"t elaborate any further about his artistic pursuits. Perplexed, Sharon went on to ask if what sort of recognition he got for his work. His answers were as short and less than satisfying as before Now \"Oh, okay.\" Sam said as he got started on his second cup, \"I see where it went wrong.\" \"You don\"t.\" \"Sure I do. You couldn\"t make conversation anymore, and you ended up suffering through periods of awkward silence mixed with forced idle chit-chat?\" \"...Okay, maybe you do.\" \"It happens to the best of us, big guy. You need to work on it, though. Women like a talker.\" \"Yeah, well, that was the start of it, but it wasn\"t really it.\" \"Oh. So what was it?\" Earlier Finally, mercifully, the food arrived. \"Oh, I. Am. Famished!\" Sharon said as their waiter placed the paste on the table. Steve knew it was less hunger and more the desire to be rid of the awkwardness. Now \"Oh, I see!\" Sam said, \"I\"ve seen Sharon eat when she\"s really hungry. She looks like a seal having a seizure.\" \"I wouldn\"t know. We didn\"t actually get to eat.\" \"How come?\" \"Well, I\"ll tell you.\" Earlier Just then, there was an explosion out in the street. The explosion large enough for the tables and glassware and windows to vibrate and for panic to arise. Steve was quick to get to his feet and rush for the door before the crowd. Now \"Wait, a seal having a seizure? Really?\" Steve asked. \"I was exaggerating for effect, Steve! There was an explosion? And I\"m only hearing this now?\" \"It wasn\"t that serious.\" \"Compared to what?\" \"It wasn\"t a terrorist attack, if that\"s what you\"re thinking. Just an armed robbery. It all turned out okay.\" \"You\"re still as erudite a conversationalist as you was with Sharon. What the fuck happened?\" \"Some heist crew wanted to rob a Stark Industries subsidiary of some brand new tech. They got what they wanted but it didn\"t go smoothly from there. They were in a police chase and crashed in the street outside Appollonia\"s. One tried an R-P-G on a squad car while they were trying to make their getaway. Luckily, they didn\"t get a kill.\" \"And then what happened?\" \"We stopped them. I mean... Well, we helped. The credit really belong to the NYPD on this.\" \"Sure. \"We\", being?\" \"Me and Sharon. It\"s a good thing she remembered to bring her gun. I didn\"t have my shield, but I managed. So anyway, we got the tech back and apprehended the crew. So, getting back to me and Sharon...\" \"Sure.\" Sam said exasperatedly, \"That clearly is the more interesting thing. Alright, so you ended up intervening in a police chase. I can understand how that would\"ve been what killed your night.\" \"No. Actually, it took the edge off.\" Earlier \"Credit where it is due, Steve,\" said Sharon as he she returned from talking to the police Captain on the scene, \"You know how to show a girl an interesting time.\" \"What\"s the situation?\" Steve asked, having come back from talking to reporters at the NYPD\"s request. \"The police are ready to cooperate and acknowledge our jurisdiction. Tony Stark\"s flying in as we speak and Hill\"s put me in charge here, said the case might be mine and Sam\"s by tomorrow.\" \"Do we know who the perpetrators were?\" \"They\"re an international crew of some renown, but this is past their usual ambitions. I\"d wager they\"re working for someone big. We\"ll know once they\"ve been interrogated by Coulson.\" \"You did good, there.\" Steve said, \"You\"re so much like Peggy.\" \"Peggy?\" It was a slip of the tongue, one he regretted immediately. It might\"ve been brought on by the thrill of the fight and the knowledge that it had ended as best as could\"ve been hoped for, that had let him put his guard down. \"Oh, you mean my great aunt. You knew her, didn\"t you?\" Sharon asked with a smile, \"Right. You worked together before she married your lieutenant. I only met her once before she died, when I was too little to remember, but she sounded like an extraordinary woman from everything I hear. I\"m flattered.\" Steve was looking into her eyes, and she\"d been looking into his. Within seconds, there\"d be a very specific glint in them and she would notice. \"Actually, Jackie\"s often told me I look a lot like her. Is it... true?\" And just like that, she put two and two together. \"Oh god.\" She mumbled, not quite mortified, but not really pleased either. That was it, he thought. That was as far as it would go. \"I\"ll take off.\" He said as he turned around and began to walk away, shame and guilt creeping on him, \"Good luck on your case.\" Now Sam stared at his friend with wide-eyed disbelief, his coffee mug hovering halfway between the table and his mouth. \"You... And her great aunt?\" he asked, a timber in his voice indicating he was somewhat upset, as he lowered his mug. \"It\"s complicated.\" \"You were engaged?\" \"No.\" \"But you were in love.\" \"I think so. I was.\" \"And you never paused to think what a dick move this is? Jesus, Cap!\" \"I know.\" Steve said with a pained expression as he stared at his mug. \"I mean when were you going to tell her? When you were in bed? Is that when you would\"ve told her you\"d also nailed her identical great-aunt?\" \"I was going to tell her, alright? Probably tonight, if it didn\"t slip out first.\" Sam grunted in distaste as he leaned back in the booth, looking out into the street outside. \"For what it\"s worth, that isn\"t something that would\"ve been an issue.\" \"It isn\"t worth much.\" Sam asked before turned back to Steve, \"Wait, what is?\" \"I never slept with Peggy.\" \"Well, you dated her. Didn\"t you?\" \"Well, not exactly... No.\" Sam gave a look of confusion and raised an eyebrow. \"To be completely precise, I did kiss her once. Well... Technically, she kissed me and I reciprocated, but I was on my way to get myself killed, so-\" \"You didn\"t go for lunch together?\" Sam asked. \"Sometimes. Just, there were always a bunch of other people with us. Bucky or Howard usually.\" \"You never went dancing, or met her mom and dad, none of that?\" \"No.\" \"Well then your date got shot in the ass for nothing.\" \"What are you talking about?\" Sam sighed as he leaned forward. \"I\"m sure this Peggy Carter was a great girl, and if she\"s anything like Red, she must\"ve been. If you\"d made it to see the war end, the two of you might\"ve got married and been happy together. We\"ll never know. But I\"m sorry to say this, but what you two had ... It isn\"t worth ruining this with Sharon, if you really were interested in her.\" \"So you\"re saying...\" Steve began hopefully, \"It isn\"t ruined?\" \"Oh no. It is ruined. I\"m saying you went about it completely the wrong way. You shoulda told her you used to have a thing for her great-aunt from that beginning. Actually, you shoulda told her months ago. Chances are, she would\"ve been cool with it.\" Steve picked up his mug of now tepid coffee and drank it all at once. \"When you see her for work tomorrow, will you tell her I\"m sorry?\" \"No, Steve. You\"re gonna have to tell her yourself.\" \"I am, aren\"t I?\" \"Never gonna hear the end of it otherwise. You better do it fast, too.\" \"Why?\" \"Women talk.\" Sam said, \"About everything. If you want to avoid a lot of funny looks, you\"ll have to talk this through with her soon.\" \"Isn\"t that a stereotype?\" \"Believe me, she might\"ve told her gal-pal Natasha by now. Hell, she might tell Chief Hill, and she doesn\"t even like her.\" \"I don\"t think a lot of people do like Maria Hill.\" \"I know. I don\"t. I mean, what the hell is her problem?\" \"It\"s twelve, gentlemen.\" The manager said, \"I\"m closing up.\" Sam and Steve got up, paid, and walked out of Carling\"s. \"Probably didn\"t think it was me you\"d be walking home tonight, did you?\" Sam joked as they walked toward his apartment building. \"Sam, how forgiving do you think Sharon is going to be?\" \"She\"ll be forgiving, don\"t worry. But forgiving enough to want to go on a second date?\" \"I know.\" Steve said, burying his hands in his pockets, \"Might as well expect the sun not to come up.\" \"Well.... I don\"t know. Maybe, who the hell knows? First you need to straighten it out with her.\"", "\"The end draws near. With a plague, He will wipe clean the earth. Game over.\" Ombre snapped her neck back and let out a gut wrenching shriek as the presence left her body. Her form slackened and was caught by Constantine before she could hit the ground. Angela moved quickly to support the girl\"s head. By now, she was sobbing, looking down at her hands. Angela gasped at the sight that met her eyes. Holes in both the girl\"s hands and feet, already beginning to close were bleeding profusely. \"What the hell...\" murmured Chaz. Without a word, Constantine picked her up allowing her to wrap her arms softly about his neck. He sets her on the bed and looked at her hands and feet. \"What the hell...\" he muttered. Ahh, sorry for the lack of updates !!! I hope this chapter is satisfactory . I feel like Constantine\"s a bit OOC in this portion, but I hope to fix that soon. And for all of you plot crunchers out there,its coming its coming (ayia) Before long, Angela had fetched a first aid kit and began to wrap bandages around Ombre\"s hands and feet. Every so often a wince or a whimper escaped her drawing a slightly concerned glare from Constantine and a little jump from Chaz. By the time the bandages were secured, John Constantine was puffing away at another cigarette. Angela turned disapprovingly. \"I thought you quit.\" His reply was a curt shrug as he walks over and kneels in front of Ombre. She slowly raised her eyes to his face and noticed a long scar extending from his cheekbone to his sharp jaw line. Cautiously, Ombre reached out and traced that line down his face. \"Did...I...?\" When he did not retract his stare, the girl flushed and quickly drew her hand away. \"Mr. Constantine, what did I say exactly?\" He took another long drag of his cigarette. \"The end is near. With a plague, he will wipe clean the earth. Game over.\" Ombre looked up once more. \"I was channeling?\" Looking down at her hands she lets out a shaky breath. \"Does this usually happen?\" Constantine looks at her upheld palms. \"No.\" At this, Ombre\"s breathing quickens as an ice cold grip chills her heart. Abnormalities of this scale in this context were never a good thing. Angela notes the panic in the room and immediately jumps to action. \"Chaz, would you give me a lift to my apartment?\" The mop of curly hair snapped his attention from the patterned tiles to the detective. \"You\"re leaving already?\" Constantine looks to her bringing the glowing Lucky Strike to his lips again. Angela placed her bag over her shoulder. \"You don\"t think I\"d let you dress a girl in one of your $100 shirts do you?\" she smirked. \"I\"ll be right back. Comon Chaz.\" With a click of the door, the apartment became empty again. Ombre shifted slightly on the bed causing a rustling of sheets. John Constantine turns and for the first time since the incident sees how truly disheveled she was. Her braid had long come loose and her hair hung in lank strands around her face. Red rimmed eyes showed a combination of lack of sleep and sobbing. Her wrapped palms and feet added to the pitiful picture and her torn dress made her look even frailer than before. John sighed knowing he didn\"t look much better. For the first time in his life, Constantine had no clue. Usually, he could wave the crying women off. It wasn\"t his job to coddle them after driving the demons out of them. That was left to panicked parents. But now, all alone in his long green apartment, there was no parent. He awkwardly coughed into his fist and paced his way over to the bed. \"Are you alright?\" Constantine\"s right hand immediately reached back to rest on the back of his neck, a well known habit of unease. Ombre nodded quickly and pressed her lips together. \"What does it mean by plague?\" She turns to look at Constantine who had regained is rough exterior. \"Your bet is as good as mine.\" he muttered. They both lapse into an easy silence, both too tired to talk of anything. The lack of sleep from the night before had finally taken its toll. As John made his way over to the couch, he noted that Ombre had already fallen asleep on the dark green coverlet of his bed. He sighs and resigns to slumber as well making sure he put out his cigarette before he stretched out on his saggy couch. Angela slowly made her way up the twisting stairs of Constantine\"s apartment followed by a Chaz laden with bags of clothing. \"Hey Chaz?\" Angela turns around abruptly soliciting a grunt of surprise from Chaz. \"Did John... Did he ever mention.....\" Before she could muster up the strength to ask if John had mentioned her, Chaz smirked and gave a reassuring chuckle. \"Don\"t worry, he was thinking about you. Made me wait outside Midnite\"s every night.\" Angela smiled and opened the scratched up door. Chaz followed her in and placed the paper bag on the table next to Constantine\"s toppled bottle of wine, making sure to avoid the burgundy trail dripping off the table. \"Both of them are asleep.\" whispered Angela as she bustled around carrying quilts and extra pillows. (Who knew John Constantine had a linen closet?) \"I think last night ran both their batteries down.\" As she bent down to cover the usually hardened exorcist with the quilt, she couldn\"t help but notice the peacefulness of his expression. He looked so much gentler, and vulnerable under the guise of sleep. She smiled to herself as she stroked his a few stray hairs off his forehead. Innocence becomes him. she mused to herself. Whoot, two chapters in one day . I hope my writing isn\"t deteriorating. My mind is shot . sleeeeeep .. R&R as always please. Criticism and praise both welcome Thankfully both John and Ombre slept into the night. Chaz and Angela, after straightening up the apartment, caved into exhaustion as well and rested their heads on the table completely knocked out. Somewhere across the city, little Timothy Gaines awoke shrieking and soaked in sweat. The door was thrown open and the lights flicked on as his parents entered the room only to gasp and draw back from their child. Angry red boils marred his once freckled face as he clawed desperately at the skin on his arms. His mother cried out and rushed to his bedside while his father called the ambulance. Back at the infamous Bowl Bowl Bowl apartment John Constantine felt the familiar tickle in his throat that always indicated a coughing fit. Swinging his long legs over the edge of the couch, he makes a mad dash to his bathroom sink, violently hacking up phlegm and blood. With one hand he grasped the edge of the porcelain sink; with the other he grasped the top of his tie and pulled it off in an attempt to open airways. Every breath he inhaled was only followed by the pain of a cough, scraping the inside of his throat raw with its force. Ombre was roused by his raucous fit and squinted in the darkness. She crept softly to the bathroom door just in time to see Constantine wiping the blood away from his mouth with the back of his hand. Slowly, he stumbled to the opposite wall and slumped down still breathing with a heavy rasp. Against all better judgment, John Constantine flicked opened his lighter and brought a new cigarette to his pursed lips with shaking hands. Perspiration stained his forehead while his collar lay open and wrinkled at the base of his neck. Ombre peered into the shadows noticing Angela and Chaz were still asleep. Deciding not to disturb the two, she crept in and sat on her knees facing Constantine. He blew a stream of smoke to the side and took a breath. \"Did I wake you?\" he rasped. The girl in front of him scowled lightly and simply plucked the Lucky Strike from its poised seat between his index and middle finger. Without a word, she crushed the glowing end of it into the green tile of the floor. John lets out a bitter half chuckle and lightly shook his head. \"I wasn\"t done with that.\" he muttered. Ombre pressed her lips together and tenatively reached and rested her pale hand lightly on the exorcist\"s forehead. \"You\"re burning up.\" she whispered. She received no response from Constantine who had his legs sprawled in front of him. He simply leaned his head back to rest on the ceramic tile pattern on the wall. \"You should go to bed.\" attempted Ombre. \"Or at least get off the floor. It\"s damp.\" Silence. Her next action came as a surprise to both of them as she boldly took Constantine\"s arm and draped it around her neck. She felt it resting there and smiled inwardly to herself liking the way it warmed her shoulders. John did nothing but gave a singular grunt of disapproval. He had little energy to do much else. Their stumbling about trying to find equilibrium in weight distribution finally resulted in a stubbed toe on Constantine\"s part. He gritted his teeth and resisted the shout of pain that pushed at his lips. By the time they reached the bed, Constantine was on the edge of oblivion and Ombre\"s cheeks were flushed with exertion and the heat generated by John\"s body. She slowly tips him onto the bed, carefully aware how close her face was to his. As she untangles his arm from her shoulders, Ombre checks his temperature again. She sighs before shuffling off to the bathroom to wet a towel to place on John\"s forehead. The damp roll of cloth felt cool beneath the palette of her fingers as she made her way back to the bed. As she approached Constantine\"s prostate form Ombre nearly dropped the towel. Angela had woken up and replaced her at the John\"s bedside. She turned at Ombre\"s gasp and smiled apologetically. \"I can take over from here.\" she whispered. Ombre felt the slight jarring of jealousy strung high in her chest as she unwillingly handed the cool cloth over. She watched as Angela gently stroked the side of John\"s face before settling herself next to him on the bed. The young girl made her way back to the couch where Constantine had been lying only minutes before. She lay down and tried to push thoughts of the exorcist out of her mind. \"When did this happen?' She asked herself. She traced back, wondering when in the course of their time together she had developed these feelings. \"This is irrational. I barely know him.' This became her silent mantra as she lay on the pea green cushions waiting for her mind to shut off. Yay Chapter 6!!! A bit of a lemon towards the end . Please enjoy and as always R&R!!! John awoke and noticed an unfamiliar pressure on the mattress beside him. He peeked over to the right and raised his head to look upon Angela\"s sleeping form. Her thick line of lashes created long elegant shadows on her pale cheeks. Her lips, slightly parted completed the portrait and created a tempting invitation for Constantine. He was never good with temptation. Constantine leans over quietly, careful not to disturb the sleeping from next to him. Gently brushing away a stray hair, he leans in and makes contact. Ever since the night on the rooftop, John had waited for this moment. He lifts his hand and strokes her cheek hoping she would wake up. On the receiving end, Angela\"s mouth slightly stiffened under his soft caresses. Rather than breaking off the kiss, she reciprocated and moved her hand to the nape of the exorcist\"s neck. As John moved himself over her body, a cough sounded from the couch causing both members to turn their heads. \"I got it.\" muttered Constantine. Angela inhaled as the pressure of his body left hers. He paced his way over to Chaz, still comatose on the worn table. \"Hey kid, get up.\" ordered John. Chaz blinked rapidly and peered up at John, shielding his eyes to the assaulting light of day. \"What?\" Being roused so quickly rendered the apprentice incapable of polysyllabic speech. \"Leave, take her with you.\" Chaz yawns and looks over at Angela who was sitting at the edge of the bed with an embarrassed smile lighting her face. \"Ohhhhhh.\" he smirks and crosses his arms. \"Sooo, that\"s why you...\" John cut him off with the infamous Constantine death glare. Chaz surrendered and threw his hands up. \"Okay okay, going. What are we supposed to do for the next hour or so?\" \"I don\"t know, get some breakfast or something.\" Chaz walked over to the couch and gently shook Ombre\"s shoulder. \"Hey, comon, we have to go.\" Ombre awoke with a start and looked up at Chaz and John standing above her. \"What\"s happening?\" she yawns and blearily rubs her eyes. Chaz looks over to John, suppressing a peal of laughter. \"Comon, I\"ll explain once we\"re outside.\" He takes her hand and leads her out the door. As she turns back to close the door, she noticed Angela. Another wave of jealously hit her straight in the chest causing her face to flush before she followed Chaz down the hallway. The boy in front of her meandered down the stairs, whistling to himself, his hands shoved into the pockets of his jeans. Ombre grasped his elbow and halted him. \"Tell me now.\" she stated simply but forcefully. Chaz\"s eye\"s widened to see the hard look on the girl\"s face. \"John and Angela haven\"t seen each other in months. Before she left, they had something going.\" He lets out a chuckle. \"It\"s about time they um let each other know how they feel, if you catch my drift.\" He winks at Ombre and continues his way down the stairs. At the words \"they had something\" Ombre\"s knees went weak and she sat down on the steps. She peered down at her bandaged hands. Well duh they had something going on. How could you be so stupid. Chaz turned to see the new recruit sitting on the step. Confused, he made his way to her and kneeled down. \"Hey, you alright?\" He wrinkled his brow and grabbed her shoulders. \"What is it? Are you channeling again? Ombre! I\"m gonna go get Constantine.\" Ombre shook her head vehemently and fought back the tears of frustration pulsing at her eyes. Chaz looked afraid at this point. \"Ombre, comon, tell me. What\"s wrong? We were just talking about.............\" His face cleared in realization and his mouth dropped open. \"Wait... Holy shit! You...I mean, you like...\" Ombre covered her face with her hands and nodded silently. \"Please, stop looking at me like that.\" \"Well, I mean, you\"ve known him for a day? When did this...How did...?\" \"I don\"t know\" she whispered. \"I\"m baffled by it too. But it just happed. And now this happened. And I just wanna crawl down the drain.\" Chaz stood stunned on the step under hers. This girl was completely different from the one he had met in the cab the night before. Before, she had almost seemed stone like, completely silent and devoid of human emotions. Now, she had been reduced to a quivering mess of energy by just spending one day with Constantine. \"Heh... I\"ve never understood what women see in him...\" Chaz joked. \"Hey, comon, let\"s go get something to eat. Forget about him for now huh?\" Ombre nodded and wiped away any tears that stained her face. Back in the apartment, months of sexual energy and raw desire exploded as the spark of contact at last occurred and set the fuse aflame. After the \"kids\" left, Constantine had silently made his way over to Angela, eyes intense, breathing quickened. As he reached her, the detective stood and lifted her chin to receive his mouth pressing hungrily on hers. One hand slid up to rest on her cheek while the other wound its way around her waist pulling her closer into the warmth of his body. She moaned softly into his lips and slowly parted her mouth to allow his probing tongue access. To hell with taking it slow. Neither party could contain their excitement as the clothes started to fly off. Before long, both stood in the nude warmed only by the heat generated by the electricity between them. Constantine moves his head down to her neck leaving a trail of kisses down to her collarbone. These ministrations elicited a slight groan of impatience from Angela and a rising arousal from John. He nudges her back, encouraging her to lie down on the bed. As he began to move down lower, Angela\"s breathing lost all rhythmic control and became erratic. John smirked to himself, easily amused by the fact that he was able to tear down a usually composed woman to such a degree. He plants several light kisses down her chest before taking a nipple into his mouth producing a full voiced moan from Angela. Slowly and deliberately, he twirled his tongue around it. Meanwhile, Angela was writhing under him, drunk with passion. She gripped the roots of his hair between her fingers and pulled him up back to her level. Without speaking, she tilted her chin up and met his lips with hers again. Before long, the lovers became impatient. Angela wrapped her long slender legs around Constantine\"s angular hips. He looked down at her, eyes glowing with longing and slowly thrust himself into her enjoying every inch of the transition. Angela arched her back to press against his chest. \"Jesus Christ\" he moaned huskily as he was enveloped by her warmth. The next passage of time was spent in a flurry of kisses, strokes, and moans of pleasure as John and Angela explored the uncharted territory of the other\"s body. When the map was complete, both cartographers lay tangled in the sheets, glistening with sweat, and panting to catch their breaths. Neither could talk, preferring instead to preserve the pristine silence that wrapped itself around them. Instead, an occasional kiss or caress marked the time after their inflamed lovemaking. They had found each other at last. Hey everyone . Sorry for the long hiatus, but finals are finally over and I am back with a vengance!!! Stay tuned for a new chapter! The two teenagers walk down the street each sipping a chocolate milkshake. Granted it was a bit early, but sugar cravings were not meant to be denied so early in the morning. An easy silence rested between them broken occasionally by a whistle of approval from Chaz every so often when a pretty girl happened to pass by. Finally, the boy turns to his female companion and smiles. \"How\"s the shake? She smiled softly to herself and bent the straw away from her mouth.\" \"I haven\"t had one in a while.\" Chaz raised his eyebrow at that. \"Where exactly did you come from. If you don\"t mind me asking that is.\" Ombre chuckled at the tactless phrasing of the question and turned to face him. \"I was living with my aunt before she died. Then Midnite took me in.\" \"You don\"t have parents?\" \"Ah, that always comes up.' she smiles to herself. \"My dad. He...had some issues.\" Chaz furrowed his brow in concern. \"You don\"t have to tell if you don\"t want to.\" Ombre looked up at him and chose to continue. \"He freaked out when I started hearing things and having fits and such. Eventually he couldnt handle the pressure and he..\" Her breathing became louder as she tried to maintain composure. \"He uh..well, kept a gun you know?\" Chaz placed his hand on her back. \"Yeah, I got it.\" \"My mom\u00a6s at Ravenscar. She didn\"t want to deal with it either.\" Chaz glances at his watch. \"I think we can go back now.\" he whispered. Ombre nodded and they turned around and made their way back to the apartment in silence. Before they made it very far, a man in a business suit stumbled out onto the street. His eyes were wild and bloodshot and his face was crowded with painful looking boils. John Gaines and his wife had just made it home from the hospital, their son bleeding out before even reaching the ER. Both of them, stained with their son\"s blood went home, stunned. There was nothing left to do. He lost his son, took a shower, and made his way off to work leaving a despondent wife at home. Cars swerved around in the street trying to avoid the lunatic in the street. \"Hey you! Get the fuck out of the street!\" The man turned, his eyes nearly popping out of their sockets. Before anyone could react, he lunged at the car, punching through the windshield of the car. The driver inside sat in stunned shock and shouted as the man gripped his throat in a vice like grip. With a seemingly inhuman strength, the infected snapped the man\"s spine. Chaz watched with his mouth agape. \"What the hell...\" Inside the apartment, the two lovers still lay entwined in each other\"s arms. The silence drifted lazily in the air and the sun provided a comforting heat. A shrill ring from the telephone disrupted the peace. Reaching over, John picked up the phone and gruffly muttered a hello. Angie laughed at this rough greeting and turns to face him. \"Right, I\"ll be right there.\" \"Exorcism?\" Angela yawns and watches as John throws the cover back and starts slipping on his pants. \"Chaz and the girl apparently saw something. Comon.\" By now both the adults were dressed and making their way down to the street. By now, the enraged man had boiled down and lay unconscious on the street. Chaz had his arms around a shaking Ombre when John arrived with Angela in tow. \"Is she okay?\" he asked looking at the girl in Chaz\"s arms. His apprentice nods and signals with a jut of his chin over to the scene. John makes his way over to the prostrate form and immediately drew back covering his nose and mouth with his arm. Bending down once more, he examined the body. Boils. He suddenly flashed back to yesterday. \"Plague will wipe clean the earth.\" With these words pounding in his hears he wordlessly got up and walked over to the sidewalk. \"It\"s the prophesy.\" he muttered and took out a cigarette. \"We have to go.\""]}
{"id": "25dd6c96-3992-56eb-baa7-0cbfe0c8ad70", "fandoms": ["Big Bang Theory", "Slayers"], "pair": ["Once Sheldon was off the phone, he took a few deep breaths before texting Penny his good news. He then proceeded to text Leonard, Raj, and Howard. Finally, he texted Bernadette. He did not text Amy as Amy had informed him not to ever text him at work again unless it was a dire emergency. She had said that since they were now working in the same building, there was no real need to text during work hours. Lunch time rolled around and Sheldon strolled into the crowded cafeteria with his food feeling like he was, figuratively speaking, on cloud nine. He saw President Siebert sitting with Doctor Gablehouser at a table near the back wall and they both happily waved at him. Being in such a good mood, he would have waved back, but since he didn\"t want to drop his food he settled for smiling at them. His euphoric mood was immediately soured when he saw Amy, sitting at their usual table with Leonard, Howard, and Raj, sobbing hysterically. Leonard and Howard were looking at each other while Raj was patting her on the back. He walked over to his usual spot at the table, put down his tray of food, looked at Amy and said \"Why are you crying?\" Raj stopped his patting and Amy took a few deep breaths and hiccuped a bit. She then turned to face him and said, \"Sheldon, you got word that you won a Nobel Prize. You told everyone in our group, even Penny, before you told me! How could you do that to me?\" Sheldon was confused. He decided to ask Amy for clarification. \"Amy, you told me not to text you at work unless it was a dire emergency. I do not believe this qualifies as a \"dire emergency\". Also, how did you know that I told Penny?\" \"Leonard told me that Penny had texted him about it,\" said Amy. \"But Sheldon, don\"t you think I would want to know something of this magnitude immediately?\" \"I also told her that you texted Bernadette,\" said Howard. Sheldon ignored him. Sheldon felt anger rising within him. \"If you wanted me to tell you this right away than you should not have told me not to text you at work!\" \"You have a point.\" Amy took her napkin and wiped her tears with it before balling it up and placing it back on the table. She then stood up and held out her hand. \"I really am happy for you.\" Sheldon looked around and saw Leonard gaping at him open-mouthed while Howard and Raj looked at each other. Sheldon chose to ignore them. \"Why are you holding out your hand?\" asked Sheldon, turning his attention back to Amy. \"Sheldon, with your eidetic memory, you will remember that in section 5 sub-section B of our relationship agreement it states that either party is deserving of a hearty handshake after winning a Nobel Prize.\" \"Very well,\" said Sheldon resignedly. He did not enjoy public displays of affection and he felt that shaking Amy\"s hand counted as such. He stood up and shook Amy\"s hand. After they both sat back down, Amy asked, \"Now that that\"s out of the way, when do we leave for Sweden?\" \"Now hold on a minute! I was thinking of taking Penny,\" he said, stiffening. He really didn\"t like it when Amy just made assumptions. \"What?\" Amy sounded extremely angry; this was not good. He glanced around the cafeteria looking for a place that he could possibly hide, but alas, the cafeteria was extremely crowded. He did, however, see Kripke sitting alone at a table in a corner and that made him feel a little better because at least he had people to sit with. \"Yes,\" said Sheldon, making sure that the volume of his voice was low to minimize the possibility of people overhearing. \"You see, awhile back, Leonard had the opportunity to visit the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland.\" \"Leave me out of this!\" interjected Leonard. \"As I was saying before we were interrupted,\" said Sheldon with a glare at Leonard, \"Leonard was going to take Penny with him to Switzerland, even though he was supposed to take me according to our friendship agreement, but both Penny and I ended up getting sick so he decided on taking Raj. I feel that both Penny and I deserve a vacation and this is the perfect opportunity.\" \"Sheldon,\" interrupted Amy, \"that is unacceptable. I am your girlfriend, therefore I should be the one to accompany you.\" He thought she sounded annoyed, but it was hard for him to be sure. \"Dude, I\"m on Amy\"s side,\" said Raj. Sheldon glared at him. \"Amy, you didn\"t let me finish!\" Sheldon saw Howard roll his eyes at Raj while Leonard sighed. \"Okay, go on,\" said Amy. \"You forget that you are on a no-fly list due to some incident when you, Penny, and Bernadette attempted to go to Las Vegas. Because of this incident, you three gals joined us in our game of Dungeons and Dragons. How can I take you to Sweden if you are on a no-fly list?\" \"We could take a boat to Sweden. It would take longer than by plane, but we\"d arrive there together. Plus we would get to share a room,\" said Amy dreamily. \"No, Amy, I refuse to take a boat.\" Sheldon felt sick at the prospect of being thrown overboard. He did not know how to swim and he didn\"t want to have to learn on the spot. Amy looked like Christmas, her favorite holiday, had been canceled. \"Then we are over.\" Sheldon saw Leonard mouth \"uh-oh\" to Howard and Raj but he chose to ignore it. Instead he returned his attention to Amy and said \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean that I wish to terminate our relationship agreement.\" Sheldon had always assumed that if Amy were to terminate the relationship agreement that he would feel anger, disappointment, and sadness. Instead he just felt relief. Much as he liked Amy\"s mind, he found it very difficult to be in a relationship with her. He did not enjoy physical contact with her in the least. Now that he was thinking about it, they really would make much better friend than anything else. \"Very well,\" he said, \"I will draw up the official termination document tonight. I hope that we still can remain friends.\" Amy didn\"t say anything. She stood up, took her tray of food, and walked over to an empty table and sat down. There was an extremely awkward silence. \"Sheldon,\" said Leonard, breaking the silence, \"you can\"t take Penny with you to Sweden!\" \"Why not? I no longer have a girlfriend, or at least I won\"t after tonight. What else is there to interfere with my taking Penny to Sweden?\" \"Penny is my girlfriend, not yours, and I forbid you to take her to Sweden!\" In Sheldon\"s opinion, the evening with Penny had gone well. Once Penny had dried her eyes and ordered their food, Sheldon found the conversation flowed easily and comfortably between them. Sheldon told Penny that his sister was pregnant and due to give birth around Christmas and how he couldn\"t understand why she wanted a home birth. To make matters worse, his mother had informed him that he would be required to witness the birth. Sheldon was pleased that Penny had said that she wouldn\"t want a home birth either and the whole thing seemed very messy. They flowed through smoothly from topic to topic and arrived at how Penny was not enjoying her physics class at all because she was struggling to understand some basic parts of the course and was struggling to keep up with the class. Since Sheldon adored physics, he had trouble understanding why anyone would not enjoy it, but he sympathized with Penny and offered, once again, to help her with physics. Sheldon was pleased that Penny accepted his offer again. Penny also told Sheldon all about how her boss was a jerk because he promoted Josh, a 19-year-old who had only been working there for a year, to Assistant Manager instead of Penny. Sheldon was on Penny\"s side because Penny had much more experience than Josh. Penny pointed out that Josh did have a better work ethic than her and while she was annoyed about being overlooked, deep down she was happy for Josh. Sheldon shared how much he was looking forward to the fiftieth anniversary special of Doctor Who. He was happy when Penny revealed to him that, through Leonard forcing her to watch Doctor Who, she had become interested in the show too. Sheldon suggested that they could watch Doctor Who together and was quite pleased when Penny smiled at him and took him up on his offer. Once the food arrived, Sheldon shared all sorts of food related trivia: peanuts are not actually nuts but really legumes; refrigerating a tomato will make it lose its flavor; and if you wash mushrooms in water than you wash away the flavor. Sheldon was delighted when Penny added to his food trivia by saying that you don\"t really have to drink milk by sell-by date because sniffing it will tell you whether or not the milk is sour. While they cleaned up from dinner, Penny expanded slightly on what she had told Sheldon earlier about her brother being incarcerated. \"He got caught doing meth again by the police. This time he\"s got five years in the slammer and a ten thousand dollar fine. My parents can\"t afford to pay the fine and my brother has no money. I have no money otherwise I\"d help.\" \"Penny,\" said Sheldon slowly, choosing his words carefully, \"giving your brother money to basically do more drugs is enabling him. I know it\"s hard because he\"s family. Family is the only real reason I would consider going to Texas to watch my sister give birth. Giving birth isn\"t illegal but abusing substances is. You do not need to feel guilty about not being able to enable your brother.\" \"It\"s just so hard,\" said Penny glumly as Sheldon watched her sit down on the couch before going over to join her. \"I know,\" Sheldon said gently as he wrapped an arm around her. It occurred to him that they were now cuddling quite frequently. It also occurred to him that there was now a stirring in his nether regions. While Sheldon did enjoy their now frequent cuddling, he did not appreciate that there was visible evidence of this fact. He shifted around, trying to find a position that would hide his slight erection from Penny. Unfortunately, while he was shifting, he accidentally bumped Penny\"s side with his groin. Sheldon was mortified that Penny now knew about his current state of sexual arousal. He felt like his face was on fire. However, despite the embarrassment, his erection refused to dwindle. He decided that the best way to deal with this situation was to leave Penny\"s apartment as quickly as possible. As he began to get up from the couch, Sheldon felt Penny\"s hand on his arm. He looked over at Penny who said to him, \"Sheldon, it\"s okay.\" \"No, Penny, it\"s not okay. I am thirty three years old, not some teenager. This should not be happening to me! It is definitely not okay! I read that book that you and Leonard gave me about the birds and the bees. While that book literally gave me nightmares, I find myself now trapped in a different kind of nightmare,\" Sheldon ranted in an attempt to explain himself. \"Earlier we were talking about babies. How do you expect to make a baby if you don\"t feel comfortable with this sort of thing?\" Sheldon found Penny\"s logic to be soothing. \"I don\"t know,\" Sheldon answered honestly as he sat back down. \"I do know that lately I\"ve been having to deal with these feelings a lot more frequently than I have in the past and it\"s all because of you! You and your wonderful-smelling hair, your nicely shaped bosom, and your ample hind-quarters!\" \"Ample hind-quarters?\" Penny\"s tone sounded slightly dangerous to Sheldon. \"Yes,\" Sheldon hurriedly explained, \"evolution has made it so that human males are attracted to females with large hips and bottoms so that there is a better chance that their offspring will be safely delivered.\" Penny burst out laughing, which confused Sheldon. Why would his current predicament be funny? \"What?\" he asked. \"You are such an ass man!\" Penny said in between bursts of laughter. \"Who would have thought that Sheldon is an ass man!\" \"Excuse me! I see nothing funny about this at all! As I explained you to you, evolution-\" \"Evolution, schmevolution! You have a deal!\" Penny\"s interruption had annoyed him, but Penny seemed to be happy and Sheldon deemed that a good thing. \"I\"m glad you\"re happy, I really am, but I still fail to see the amusement in sexual arousal!\" \"Oh Sheldon,\" he heard Penny say with a sigh, \"never mind.\" Penny leaned over and gave him a peck on the cheek! To Sheldon\"s absolute astonishment, he found that he didn\"t mind the kiss at all! He knew that it was wrong to compare, but he couldn\"t help it because for some intangible reason, Penny\"s kiss was infinitely more enjoyable than any time Amy had every kissed him. Sheldon took a few slow, deep breaths to clear his head. Once the fog had cleared and his heart had slowed down to a normal rate, he realized that his erection was gone. With a sigh and a smile, he decided that he should make his exit so that he could attempt to get to sleep on schedule. When Sheldon got up in the morning, he was glad to find that there was no sign at all of Leonard in the apartment. This made Sheldon quite happy because he was still furious with his roommate. In fact, after he had come home the night before after visiting Penny, he hadn\"t said a single word to the man. Sheldon was so happy about Leonard not being there that morning that the cereal that he selected to eat was the one with the lowest fiber content on the shelf. He mused briefly about how pleasant this morning would be before he gleefully turned on the television and watched Doctor Who. Sheldon completed his normal Saturday morning routine, dressing in his yellow Hawkman t-shirt, a green thermal, and a gray pair of pants. He then decided that he would read some of his comic books before eating lunch and heading over to the tailor\"s with Penny. He was just sitting down on his spot on the couch with the latest copy of \"Green Lantern\" in his hand when he heard the door to the apartment unlock. He looked over and saw Leonard enter. He decided not to say anything and instead opened his comic book, ignoring his roommate. He hoped, rather more desperately than he would care to admit, that Leonard would ignore him too so that his morning could continue to be pleasant. Unfortunately, Sheldon was out of luck. He sighed softly to himself as Leonard started to speak. \"Sheldon, I need to tell you something.\" Sheldon decided that he was too angry to further ignore Leonard, so he carefully and pointedly placed his comic book on the coffee table and gave Leonard his best glare. Leonard scuffed his shoe on the floor and, fidgeting, said, \"Amy and I spent the night together.\" Sheldon glared in silence at Leonard. He really didn\"t care anymore about Leonard and Amy since, as far as he was concerned, he was done with both of them. What irked him more than anything was Leonard\"s hypocrisy and, with a sudden burst of clarity, he knew that he was tired of Leonard altogether. He realized now that he really didn\"t want to see Leonard\"s face again. He recognized that would be an impossibility since they worked together, but he knew that he could do one thing to limit their interactions. On impulse, he decided to do it. Sheldon broke the awkward silence that hung in the room like a cloud by saying, \"Leonard, I wish to dissolve the roommate agreement. I want you out by November first, which, in case you didn\"t know, is Friday.\" After a couple of seconds, Sheldon heard Leonard say, \"What? Why?\" Leonard sounded truly flabbergasted. \"Because,\" said Sheldon with a hint of exasperation as he stood up, \"as you know, rent is due on the first day of every month. You have paid your half of the rent dutifully so it wouldn\"t be fair to make you leave before then.\" Sheldon felt like he was talking to an imbecile. \"Oh, come on Sheldon! You can\"t just kick me out!\" Sheldon was no expert, but he thought that Leonard both looked and sounded angry. \"Leonard, my name is on the lease so I can, in fact, kick you out. Consider yourself lucky that I\"m giving you until the first of the month!\" Sheldon was quickly losing patience with Leonard. He was also starting to regret his choice of breakfast cereal for the morning. \"Where am I supposed to go on such short notice?\" \"I don\"t know,\" Sheldon bellowed, \"Nor do I care! How about you go live with Amy?\" \"Fine,\" shouted Leonard, \"You do know this means that you won\"t get any money from me for my half of the rent, utilities, phone, cable, and Internet?\" Vaguely, Sheldon wondered if Leonard thought that he was an idiot. He took a slow, deep breath to calm himself down and to try to prevent any further outbursts. \"I am completely aware of what you moving out entails,\" Sheldon said tightly. \"I am also completely aware that you only pay half of the rent and utilities and I pay fully for phone, cable, and Internet!\" \"Fine!\" Leonard shouted petulantly before stomping off in the direction of his soon-to-be ex-room. Sheldon wished that Leonard wouldn\"t stomp. He was, however, consoled by the thought that Leonard would soon be gone from his apartment forever. As he heard the door to Leonard\"s room slam, Sheldon looked at his watch. He was pleased to note that it was now 10:30 am, which meant that he only had another half an hour before he could knock on Penny\"s door and beg her to let him hide from Leonard at her apartment. He sat back down on his spot and picked up \"Green Lantern\" again and tried to read it. Alas, he found that he was too angry to properly focus on reading the comic book. So he just sat there silently, on his spot, holding the thin paper loosely between his fingers. Sheldon thought about life without Leonard living in his apartment. The downside to the situation was that Leonard might decide to take the couch with him. After all, the couch was purchased by Leonard. He spent a few minutes pondering whether evicting Leonard was worth losing his 0,0,0,0 for. He was miserable living with Leonard. On the other hand, he would be unhappy without his spot. He decided ultimately that being miserable was worse than merely being unhappy. He was now confident that he had made the right decision to terminate the roommate agreement. Sheldon was feeling both happy and excited as he stood in front of Penny\"s door. According to his watch, which he had checked three times in the past minute, it was 10:58 am. He wished that time would somehow hurry up. While he only had approximately two minutes before he could knock on the door, he was feeling impatient. He looked at his watch again and saw that it was now 10:59 am. Screw it, he was going to knock anyway. Even if Penny punched him in the throat, it would be worth it because he would be seeing her. Sheldon was just about to raise his fist to knock when the door opened. Since he hadn\"t actually started his knocking routine yet, Sheldon decided that he was okay with this turn of events. He looked at Penny and saw that she was dressed in a violet v-neck sweater and a dark blue pair of jeans. Her hair was down and flowed over her shoulders. He thought that she looked cute. He smiled and said, \"Hello, Penny.\" \"Hello, Sheldon,\" said Penny as she stepped out of his way. \"Sorry that I opened the door early and you didn\"t get to do your knocking thing.\" \"That\"s alright,\" said Sheldon as he entered the apartment. He closed the door behind him and asked, \"Just out of curiosity, why did you open the door if you knew it was not yet eleven o\"clock?\" \"I was actually on my way to see you. I missed you,\" said Penny. Sheldon saw her blush. \"What are you doing here so early?\" Sheldon heard Penny ask as he plopped down on her couch. \"I got into a fight with Leonard,\" he answered. He didn\"t really want to talk about it but he thought that Penny should know, especially since he had come to her apartment early. \"Another one? What was this one about?\" asked Penny as she flicked a light switch on the wall down into the off position and a kitchen light turned off. \"Good thing I didn\"t actually leave because I forgot to turn that off.\" Sheldon ignored Penny\"s comment about the light because he suspected that she had mostly said that to herself. He just answered the question with, \"Leonard spent the night with Amy and I had enough of his hypocrisy.\" \"Hypocrisy?\" \"Yes,\" answered Sheldon. \"As you know, he forbade you from going to Stockholm with me and now he\"s sleeping with Amy. I suspect that they engaged in coitus.\" \"Don\"t say \"coitus,'\" Penny said, wrinkling her nose, reminding Sheldon that she didn\"t like that word. \"I\"m glad we\"re not going out with them anymore.\" \"I agree. Oh, I wanted to tell you that I terminated my roommate agreement with Leonard.\" \"You did what?\" Penny sounded shocked. \"I terminated my roommate agreement with Leonard,\" Sheldon repeated with a sigh. As much as he liked Penny, which was quite a bit, he really wished that she would work on her listening skills. \"Why did you do that?\" Penny asked as she worked her way across the room, closer to him. \"I terminated our roommate agreement because I am tired of seeing Leonard and dealing with his issues,\" explained Sheldon. \"I no longer wish to live with the man. I gave him until Friday to leave. I suppose that I should start looking into getting a new roommate.\" Penny sat down next to Sheldon on the couch which pleased Sheldon immensely. He looked over at Penny and noticed that her right bra strap was showing so he said, \"Penny, your right bra strap is showing.\"", "The remaining golem flung yet another projectile at him. Dodging out of the way, Zelgadiss, ran as he dodged a flying stone yet again. Zelgadis didn\"t dare use the Makushirue Riposte again, it would have taken a lot out of him, too much to risk when he didn\"t know what other traps were within the laboratory. Now that he didn\"t have to dodge two golems, Zelgadiss was free to move about the clearing trying to get out of the golem\"s arc of fire. A few moments later Zelgadiss was behind the golem\"s back and preparing a couple spells to take care of it. Gathering the Earth magic Zelgadiss cast a Dug Haut, causing a slight earthquake as stalagmites shot out of the ground at roughly even points encircling the Ashlar golem. Zelgadiss quickly followed up with Ly Briem, encasing the golem and its earthen prison in a chunk of solid ice, thus effectively neutralizing the golem. Zelgadis let out a breath as he scanned the area with his eyes for enemies, and then again for any magical traps. Finding nothing of note he went over to where he\"d fallen from the tree, picked up the branch, and made his way down the stairs. Just before reaching the limits of the outside light Zelgadiss used a simple fire spell to light the branch. He\"d forgotten to get torches while he was in the town, and while he didn\"t particularly need them with magic at his disposal, he\"d rather use magic for something important. He was a magic using swordsman, not a sword using mage. As Zelgadiss\"s eyes adjusted to the sudden increase in the light Zelgadiss was surprised to see the passage in front of him filled with a fog or mist that suddenly stopped a few feet from where he was standing. He couldn\"t sense any magic holding the fog back, but he could see it\"s effects. Zelgadiss briefly wondered if he should cast a fireball down the passage to see what would happen, then decided against it, he could very well destroy what he was looking for. Besides, he didn\"t want his name to be synonymous with terror like his friend, Lina Inverse\"s was. Bracing himself, either to jump up or back or drop to the floor, Zelgadiss stepped through the boundary of the mist. Nothing happened for a few seconds, so, he pushed on, until his makeshift torch snapped as the fire reached some particularly wet portion of the wood and he dropped it jumping back. He hadn\"t realized it but the mist was definitely starting to get to him, he couldn\"t see any reason for its presence and that grated at his mind however he tried to ignore it. He had heard of something like it, but years ago, and he hadn\"t actually been paying attention at the time. Zelgadiss decided that it would be prudent should he expedite his search. Quickening his pace to something less than a jog but more than a power-walk Zelgadiss almost missed the sealed doorway. It was mechanically sealed and not magically, which surprised Zelgadiss, he hadn\"t seen anything about the lab to suggest the monetary resources required to install physical security like this. Zelgadiss simply pulled out a small padded package from one of his pockets, unrolled the contents, and looked through the picks with the eye of a professional. Selecting one, he slipped it into the keyhole as he grabbed another and put it in at an angle to the first. After several false starts the key unlocked and opened revealing a small round dial embedded into the door. Zelgadiss had to smile at that as he grabbed his makeshift stethoscope, two pure mechanical locks, whoever owned this lab was paranoid of other magic users. The door finally opened to a short almost antechamber-like passage that was filled with bookshelves on the walls. The books looked like they might be interesting, though Zelgadiss doubted that he would find anything among them now. The main room of the laboratory was quite cluttered, various chemicals and mixtures were in seemingly random locations, and the benches were littered with notes of all types, subjects, and ages. There was one reminding the writer that there was a town meeting he wanted to attend, another stated that the results from a test were favorable, yet another seemed to contain a half finished spell that was hastily written. The last one Zelgadiss had picked up was actually a sheaf of notes held together with a bit of wire that had been twisted into an elongated spiral and flattened. Flipping the half-writen spell back revealed a map, and the n there were notes on an Obelisk at the far edge of the desert through a pass in the mountains just south-east of his position. There also seemed to be several pages of notes in an unintelligible shorthand. Though the last two were quite readable, one gave specific conditions for a certain summoning, and the other was a fairly detailed plan for a chimera with something scribbled about two bodies needed in the corner. Zelgadiss put the entire set of documents in his pack and left the laboratory. The hallway was no longer filled with the foggy mist. The walls were dripping wet and the floor had almost enough water to splash, Zelgadiss guessed that was all that remained of the fog, but this somehow didn\"t feel right, and not just because it was cold enough for him to see his breath. Making his way purposefully back aboveground, Zelgadiss noticed that the water level seemed to be getting higher, as his boots splashed little droplets of water with each hurried step, until finally the water was up to the soles of his boots and audibly splashing the legs of his pants with icy-cold water. Zelgadiss was relived to see that the golem\"s prision had melted almost minimally, but what had melted was draining down the stairs and into the underground passage. Zelgadiss almost laughed in his relief, the reason everything had seemed wrong down there was because the golem was linked to the laboratory by a strong magical link. The magic imprisoning the golem had \"bled\" into the area that the golem had been tied to. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Now, as he made his way through the desert, he hoped that he would be there in time to investigate this obelisk. He looked to his right as he thought he heard chanting, not the singular intonation of s single voice, but the polyphony of a crowd of voices, coming from a giant dust cloud. Ten minutes later he was sure of it. The chant was musical but still a chant, in a language he\"d never heard before, and was punctuated by the sounds producing some complex rhythm. Curious as to what might be going on Zelgadiss began walking toward the dust cloud. As he got nearer to the dust cloud he could see that the dust was being stirred up by a vaguely human shapes engaged in a complex ritual. They each held a long spear or staff-like object and mirrored each other\"s moves so perfectly that Zelgadiss could almost have sworn that they were all puppets tied to the same strings. When he finally could see the gathering clearly, despite the dust being stirred up, he was surprised at what he saw. They were Ophidians, relatives of the snake-men, who were known for their willingness to help mages, for a price. They were considered to be the mercenaries of the magic world as they sold their services freely to any who would pay and seemed to have no inherent loyalty. Which made seeing two of the reptilian creatures working together extremely rare... much less the five-to-eight hundred that were here now. All of them had an alpenstock tipped with a ruby set in Orihalcon and intricately worked with a gold pattern in what appeared to be a redwood shaft. It was with these instruments that they were scratching a pattern into the ground with their ritual, creating a sound like a thousand feet being dragged across the dry earth at the same time. There was an eerie rhythm to the practice as the Orphidians simultaneously thrust their alpenstocks into the ground and continued the ritual without pause. Zelgadiss almost jumped when he saw that they were fashioning a Magic Arc, not that Ophidians didn\"t construct Magic Arcs, Circles, and Squares, but the sheer size of it... it was huge. And the patterns were definitely unique compared to any he\"d seen, except for those on his grandfather\"s giant Magic Circle. \"Ah! Hello there!\" Zelgadiss whirled at the voice. \"You\"ve made it just in time. I was wondering if you would make it... but then the prophesies did say you would be here.\" An old man in long black and red, or were they red and black, robes with a long grey beard and a pair of glasses perched on his nose looking very much like the caricature of a wizard. \"Prophecies.\" Zelgadiss wasn\"t sure if he wanted to know what prophecies this old man was trying to link him to, so hi simply didn\"t make it a question. \"Yes. You are the Dark Warrior, and the prophecies said you would be here to see your companions summoned.\" The old man grinned, gesturing at Zelgadiss\"s near black skin, as he offered his hand. \"I am Galvanaas, Mage Extroplier.\" Zelgadiss\"s eyebrow reached upwards, Mage Extroplier was one of the top ranks in the Rankin Guild. As far as he knew only two others besides his grandfather had received the title which meant that he would be quite formidable if he were to turn out to be an enemy. \"Zelgadiss Greywords.\" Zelgadiss introduced himself. \"Come,\" Galvanaas smiled and gestured for Zelgadiss to follow him as he led away. Toward the Magic Arc\"s focal point. \"Things are about to begin.\" Galvanaas and Zelgadiss reached a slightly elevated obsidian pedestal nearly eighty feet in diameter and as Galvanaas led Zelgadiss to the side opposite the Magic Arc Zelgadiss noticed that everything had become quiet, the Orphidians had stopped their chant and the dance-like moves with the that stirred up dust with their alpenstocks. Galvanaas gestured overhead, to the sun. Zelgadiss looked up and saw that the moon was about to cross the sun\"s face resulting in a solar eclipse. As he stood there, the sky slowly began to darken, and the Orphidians began to hum a short five note musical phrase which the repeated until they suddenly stopped. After a pause of exactly two and a half heartbeats they began chanting a single spell. Zelgadiss suppressed the involuntary shiver as the air suddenly turned icy and the Orphidians finished their spell binding the air itself to their Magic Arc. The air had almost darkened to it\"s full extent, and Galvanaas began a single spell of summoning. The Magic Arc was gathering both the power of shadows and the power of light that fell into this large area of the desert, the area that it covered was glowing red and giant bolts of blue-white energy crackled along as it redirected them into the Magic Circle inscribed into the obsidian pedestal which was beginning to glow with a soft green light that reached up a foot from the surface of the dark surface. Zelgadiss couldn\"t imagine how all this power was being pushed into a single summoning spell, this much power could easily kill every living thing on the plain of Ganthar and here it was being used for a single summoning!? Things were almost finished when a growling voice yelled \"You\"ve meddled enough old man! You will not be allowed to challenge the resurrection of our lord Shabrandigo.\" Zelgadiss watched in shock as a high level Mozoku seemed to step out of thin air, threw it\"s hand forward, and launched a silver ray at the old man as he finished the spell, or rather ended it, instead of a full summoning that would pull the summoned beings through it was as if a door had been opened to be stepped through. The Orphidians massed around the Mazoku and attacked all at once with an Elemenkia Lance, and while that high level of a Mazoku could stand up to a single Elemenkia Lance nearly eight-hundred was a different matter as the creature died a sudden and yet painful death. One of the Orphidians stepped up to Galvanaas and practically begged Zelgadiss to heal him. \"Massster sssaved tribe! Massster wasss good to usss, never treated usss badly like our cousssinsss. Massster mussst sssurvive to inssstruct companionsss. I would try to heal massster, but Massster\"sss Orphidiansss only know ssspirit ssshamanisssm.\" The creature nervously flicked out a tongue. Zelgadiss was somehow touched by the loyalty the Orphidians showed to the old magician, he wasn\"t greatly skilled with healing magics as he almost never needed to use them himself. Zelgadiss decided to do what he could as the Orphidians watched in an almost tangible concern for their master. They never saw the two figures emerge from the summoning. Author\"s Note #1: Zel\"s skin is a dark blue in the novels, almost black, I\"ve only seen the anime, but I thought it\"d be better to go with a dark-blue Zel for this fic rather than the pale-blue of the anime. I also wanted some leeway in case of inconsistency with the anime and other resources as it\"s a somewhat different universe. This also gives me a little play-room with Zel\"s back-story, and Rezo\"s as well, something that I feel will prove indisposable in the future of this story. (Besides, it\"ll be fun!) Author\"s Note #2: I didn\"t chose 276 lbs arbitrarily. I took 138 pounds, a reasonable weight estimate for Zelgadiss who is an inch or two within my height, and he\"s a little more muscular than I (I weigh about 130). Anyway, I divided his weight into two halves and multiplied one half by three as stone\"s density is thrice that of water, giving my 207 lbs, to which I added the unmodified half, resulting in a grand total of 276 lbs. Author\"s Note #3: Makushireu is supposed to be the \"Japanization\" of the name Maxwell, if anyone has the actual syllabary spelling of it please drop me a line. Misc. Notes: I\"m thinking of italicizing spell names, both spoken and otherwise. I think that it may help readability, but then again it could be distracting, what do you think? Comments & Criticisms are not only welcome but encouraged as I don\"t do much serious writing. Also even there are three intros up I would like reviews on each separately, that way I can find out what I\"m doing right and what I\"m not. Thank you. efish@cs.nmsu.edu The Angst Team Intro 2: A Brief Ray of Light Ryoga looked around the small antique and oddity shop, he was looking for some trinket to give Akane when he finally returned to the tendo dojo. There were some things he thought Akane would find interesting, an old painted wood carving, a small china figurine, but a medium sized ornate clock is what caught his attention he most. It was worked in ornately intricate patterns and the materiel looked like wood but felt more like a metal when he picked it up to examine it. The clock was heavy compared to today\"s lightweight plastic electronics, but it still would work when the electricity was knocked out, an occurrence that was very common at the dojo, and to a lesser extent Nermia itself, with the extensive property damage they frequently incurred. Ryoga was placing the clock back when he noticed something it had been sitting on, a map folded into a small square and bulky compass. Ryoga picked them up after setting the clock down, he smiled sardonically at the irony of his finding a map and compass. He laughed, he couldn\"t help it, it was just too funny to him... the Eternally Lost finding a map and compass, his laugh gained the edge of hysteria. \"Oh, I see you\"ve found it.\" The young proprietor of the store said from right behind him, scaring him into silence. \"You know that map\"s supposed to reveal the location of a magical treasure...\" \"Oh, then why haven\"t you found it.\" Ryoga asked, suspiciously. The young proprietor, no more than eighteen or nineteen, laughed, \"Oh, believe me I\"ve tried. Mr... \" \"Hibiki Ryoga.\" \"Well, Mr. Ryoga, if you open the map you\"ll see it\"s in runic. I\"ve tried to decipher it, as has everybody else in my family, but all any translation turns out is gibberish. I\"m beginning to think that it\"s just some old Viking\"s idea of a joke.\" Ryoga\"s eyes went to the runes. \"Really, and the compass?\" Ryoga asked, he tried to stay away from magic after his... accident at Jusenkyo, but perhaps it was also the key to his cure. \"That thing? I found it a while back in a garage sale, I tried to open it, but it seems I\"m not quite that strong.\" the boy said shrugging, \"The case makes it look like it\"s carved from stone, but the hinges are stuck. Even if it doesn\"t work it\"s a good display piece.\" \"How much do you want for the clock?\" Ryoga indicated with the compass, still thinking about the map and compass as the boy named a figure. \"How about...\" Ryoga named a slightly higher figure for the clock, the map, and the compass. The boy\"s eyes lit up. \"Deal!\" he said excitedly. As Ryoga left the store he wondered why he\"d bought the map and compass, the map he could understand, sort of, as it might hold the cure to his curse. But what about the compass, what had possessed him to buy the compass. Reaching into his pocket he pulled out the compass and looked at it. It looked like it was carved from stone because of it\"s cover, but under the small viewhole he could see the compass\"s inner workings spin as they tried vainly to zero in on their destination. Ryoga tried to open it for a few minutes but the thing wouldn\"t budge, which was rather surprising considering his strength. \"Boy, he wasn\"t kidding when he said it was stuck.' Ryoga thought, wondering about how he could open it the Baksai Tenketsu immediately sprang to mind, but that would destroy it unless... Ryoga focused his ming as if in preparation to use his Baksai Tenketsu, the \"Breaking Point\", on the object and when he saw the point in his mind, instead of hitting it with an extended forefinger tried prying at the point. It was all to no avail though as the compass remained adamant in it\"s refusal to open. Ryoga angrily thrust the compass into his pocket and pulled out the map. Opening it up, he immediately started reading the runes. Nobody who knew Ryoga\"s traveling habits would have been shocked that he was fluent in every major language on the planet but they never would have guessed that he could read, write, and speak several dead ones as well. \"I never thought getting lost in that university in Greenland or Iceland or wherever it was would have been helpful. I wouldn\"t know runic if I hadn\"t been in that classroom for most of a semester and a half.' Ryoga started to read the runes aloud. Something sounded familiar about the words he was saying, but he couldn\"t quite put his finger on it. Then he came to a word, a name, Cursebreaker. Ryoga couldn\"t believe it as his hands shook with excitement he looked at the map trying to memorize it and see if anything on it was familiar at the same time. It was all a futile effort a small voice screamed in the back of his mind but he was so close he could almost feel it. He would never have to turn into a pig again, and maybe, just maybe, he could cure his directional curse as well. * * * * * * * * * * Ryoga looked around, he was somewhere in a forest, he didn\"t know how he\"d gotten here. He\"d been so busy trying to absorb every detail on the map that he hadn\"t paid any attention to where he was going. \"Not that it would make much difference, I get lost even when I am paying attention to where I\"m going.' Ryoga sighed as he folded his map and put it back into his pocket, walking along in random directions as he did so, he felt a vague sense of familiarity creep over him as he stepped out of the forest\"s edge and stared at the building in front of him. \"Furinkan Highschool...\" Ryoga said as he blinked in surprise, he hadn\"t even been trying to get here this time... and wasn\"t the shop he\"d just been in located in Australia, just north-west of Florida? Well, as long as he was in the area he could wait for Akane to show up and give her the clock. He took his pack off, sat down, and began to set up camp within eyesight of the front gate. The beans weren\"t exactly the best he\"d seen, but they\"d been cheap and he\"d bought ten pounds or so when he was in Mexico the other day, before making his way east into France and then on to Nigeria. Ryoga settled down to watch the stars come out as the beans cooked, wondering why the runic words had sounded so familiar aloud when they were just gibberish, the few real words not fitting grammatically into any coherent thought. * * * * * * * * * * \"I\"m sure Ranma and Akane will show up today...' Ryoga thought on his third day at Furinkan, then he thought for a moment and pulled out the small day planner he had in his pack. \"What!?\" He exclaimed as he looked through the book. \"It\"s June second!! The school\"s closed for the summer!\" Growling about the wasted time being Ranma\"s fault Ryoga started packing his camp back into the pack. \"Now I\"ll spend a week trying to find the dojo, and with my luck they\"ll all be gone on a family vacation.\" Ryoga thought rather dismally as he finished packing the last of his things. * * * * * * * * * * The semi drive pounded on the brakes again to no avail. His truck was out of control and he couldn\"t stop, barely holding back panic he toggled the engine brake, effectively turning the huge Diesel engine into a giant air compressor. Inertia still reigned, and with that many tons he would be going for some time. The driver watched in horror as a young man with dark brown hair stepped into the street directly in front of him. The driver let out a gasp as he herd the *thunk* \"Not good. Definitely not good. Even if those basterds cut my break lines, but when I blew the whistle on their drug operation I knew it could come back to haunt me.'"]}

His hot, sticky breath on Philly ear made her want to be sick. She kicked back and hit her attacker\"s thigh, but he didn\"t even flinch. \"Bad girl, huh?\" He laughed. Then he called for someone named Bud. Another big man, bigger than the one already holding her, came out of the shadows. Philly realized that this was the man she had seen riding up. Bud came up to her and twisted her head around, her chin pinched in between his fingers. Philly looked up at his face and saw his high, Indian looking features, stretch as he smiled. He pulled a coin from his pocket and flipped it, then asked his friend to call it. The man holding Philly said heads, the coin had landed on heads. Fear filled Philly\"s entire being as she realized there was no one who was going to save her. As a last resort she began to squirm and scream and kick, but Bud grabbed her legs until the other man had her on the ground, straddling her. Sam heard one short scream and then it was cut off. He recognized it as a woman\"s scream and he and his horse galloped across the fields. Another scream told him where he wanted to go. Within a half-hour of galloping and on and off screams, Sam found what he was looking for. He saw two big men hunched around a woman lying on the ground. One was messing with his pants and the other was messing with the girl\"s...britches. Sam\"s eyes widened when he recognized the britches and the horse tied off to the side. Without thinking, Sam pulled his gun and shot into the trees. The bigger of the two men looked up and scrabbled for his gun. As soon as he got it in his hand and aimed it, Sam shot him twice in the chest. He reloaded and killed the other as well. Once they were both dead, Sam rode down the small hill and leapt off his horse. He kneeled down beside Philly, whose eyes were closed and had sweat beading on her forehead. Sam awkwardly fixed her britches and her shirt then picked her up in his arms. Her eyes opened and she hugged him, tears streaming down her face. \"Are you alright?\" Sam asked, though he knew that it was a stupid question. She obviously was very frightened. \"I can walk.\" She said and Sam put her down. She doubled over and was sick for a minute. Sam pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and let Philly wipe her mouth. \"Here, get up on my horse.\" He said. Philly looked back at her own horse and began to walk over to him, but Sam steered her to his own. \"No, we\"ll come back and get him later, I promise.\" Sam rode into the Ponderosa and carefully helped Philly down. Sam, wanting to get Philly help quick, picked her up and ran up to the house. He opened the door and walked into the living room. \"Ben! Adam! Hoss! Little Joe!\" He called trying for at least one of the many Cartwright boys. Ben came in from the kitchen and stopped in his tracks when he saw Sam holding his little girl. \"What do you think you\"re doing?\" Ben said, venom in his voice. Sam explained the situation and Ben took his daughter from Sam. He helped her to stand up and asked to explain. \"I\"m so sorry, Daddy.\" She cried. She just couldn\"t bring herself to say the words. \"I-I...they...Oh, Daddy!\" She collapsed into tears and Sam felt completely helpless as he watched Ben Cartwright try and help his daughter. Then an idea came to him. \"Mr. Cartwright, do you want me to fetch a doctor?\" Sam asked. Ben shook his head. \"No, I want you to get Little Joe to fetch a doctor. Bring Hoss and Adam here.\" Sam nodded and did as he was told. Adam paced the floor and Hoss was in a fit. Never had Philly seen Hoss so angry. Rose sat next to her and was holding her hand and petting her hair. The last thing Philly wanted to do was be touched right now, but she didn\"t want Rose to just feel helpless. Adam turned to Sam. \"And you said that you killed both men?\" He asked. Ben had gone to get the sheriff. Sam nodded from where he stood in the corner of the room. \"I would\"ve gotten there faster if her screams had been...\" Sam paused; he realized Philly was listening intently. \"...A little more consistent.\" The door opened and the doctor came in, followed by Little Joe. The doctor walked over to Philly and asked her if he could examine her upstairs. Philly couldn\"t make herself look him in the eye. Again the door opened and this time Ben came in. The doctor looked up at Ben, then back to Philly. \"You can have someone in the room with you, if that makes you feel more comfortable.\" He said. Philly nodded. \"Daddy? Could you...?\" Ben nodded in answer. The Philly turned to look at Sam. \"Sam Kirby. Would you please?\" She asked, a begging tone in her voice. Sam seemed surprised, as did everyone else in the room. \"S-sure.\" Sam said. Two months later, the doctor confirmed Philly\"s worst fear. She was pregnant. Sam had been right by her side when she found out. Since he had redeemed himself in the eyes of the Cartwright family, he had helped Philly through every step of the way. Okay, this chapter was a little intense, and I apologize for that, but I wanted to have Philly go through some major test, and we\"ll soon see how well she does. Okay, so it\"s been a while, and I know towards the end of the last chapter that I kinda rushed through, so I\"ve decided to go through some sub-plots in between. This story is about Little Joe\"s suspicions of Sam Kirby, right after the doctor found that Philly had indeed been...taken advantage of. Hope you enjoy and Please Review! Sam leaned against the wall in the room upstairs. The doctor had Philly\"s legs spread and a blanket overtop. Ben was holding her hand and she was crying softly. Never had Sam gotten so accustomed to a person so fast! This little girl just showed up and Sam felt like a bull being lead from a path of slaughter to the pasture. That was the best he could explain it. After a few moments, the doctor stood straight up and nodded solemnly to Ben, who tensed. Back downstairs; Little Joe was in a fury. He was pacing and he had pulled down the fencing sword and was slashing the air violently. \"How can you be sure?\" Adam tried to reason with his younger brother, though it never really worked. Joe pointed the sword at him. \"I\"m just sure. I know he\"s the one who did it. You can\"t trust him.\" Hoss scoffed at his brother\"s assuredness and shook his head. \"Little Joe, you are so full of-.\" But he was cut off when the door upstairs opened. Sam Kirby came down the stairs. He was crumpling his tan hat in his gloved hands and his eyes were downcast. Little Joe approached him and jabbed the tip of his sword into Sam\"s chest. Sam looked up and smacked the sword away. Anger filled his eyes, though Joe mistook it for fear. \"What do you want?\" Sam asked. He kept his tone of voice guarded. \"I want the truth.\" Joe snarled. Sam looked at him with confusion. \"What on God\"s earth are you talking about?\" \"I think that you were the one who hurt my sister.\" Joe\"s face was contorted with rage. Adam and Hoss\" faces filled with surprise, they had never seen Joe so angry. He looked like a mad dog. Sam felt like knocking Little Joe on his butt, but he knew that he was outnumbered. If he were to attack a Cartwright, he would never work there again. But the idea of him hurting Philly was so preposterous. He couldn\"t ever do that to ANY girl, let alone the daughter of his employer. He needed to stay at the ranch to be able to collect information for the gang hanging out in the bush. If he got fired, they would not only most likely be arrested, but they would kill him. Quite literally. \"What is wrong with you?\" Sam demanded. \"I have never done ANYTHING to you except break a stallion faster than you.\" \"The other day I saw you pull a gun on my brother.\" Little Joe said with certainty in his voice. It was true that while they were looking for the gang of bank-robbers, Hoss had come a little too close to the hide-out. Sam had only had his hand on the butt of the gun and Little Joe had come riding up behind him. But Sam didn\"t think he would have really shot the bigger man. \"I already told you that was because I heard someone come ridin\" up without heed and I just wanted to be safe.\" He lied. He was good at lying. Everyone except Little Joe had accepted that story and were content. Little Joe wasn\"t. Joe tossed his sword across the room so it ended up in the wall and took a step closer to Sam. \"I swear. I will see you dead for what you\"ve done to my sister.\" With that he stormed out of the house and jumped on his horse and rode off. Rose ran after him. Adam walked up to Sam while Hoss pulled the sword out of the wall. \"You know that we don\"t really believe that.\" Adam tried to say. But Sam would have none of it. All his life he had been plotted against and he was too used to it to bear it any longer. \"I can\"t believe that can I? I\"ll be out herdin\" the cattle, unless you can\"t trust me there either?\" With his words filled with venom, Sam left. Yep, there\"s more! More of the confusion, disillusionment, and craziness that the Cartwright family seems to go through every day. Hmmm, will Sam earn trust? Will he prove that he doesn\"t deserve it? . I\"m too excited! Let\"s find out! Sam looked out over the cattle in the small valley. They all seemed to be grazing peacefully and Sam longed to sap that feeling of security to ease his insulted pride. Worry for Philly creased his brow as he retreated into his own mind. He thought about the gang and how they treated him when he had been run out of his old home town. They had welcomed him like brothers, though Sam soon learned not to trust any one of them. Always there was a man with a bullet at his back and a gloved hand in his pocket. It was when Sam had beaten a man who tried that on him that Sam was promoted to Second Pistol. Now he only took orders from the gang\"s First Pistol, Cash. Cash was the most ruthless of men, throughout the gang there were rumors of Cash shooting his own mother and baby brother when she had threatened to turn him in to the sheriff for selling off their cattle he had no right to. As Sam thought of Cash, he swore that he saw that very man ride up the hill opposite him. Fear struck him and he didn\"t know what to do. But when he focused his eyes he saw that it was only Rose. She was galloping toward Sam and a sudden urge to run came to Sam\"s mind. He shook his head. Why on earth should he be afraid of Rose? That was like being afraid of Hoss or Adam. He gritted his teeth as he steadied his horse when Rose finally came up to him. \"Hello.\" She smiled unusually broad. She turned to pull something out of her saddlebags and Sam watched warily. \"Hey.\" He answered as she pulled out a water satchel. She tossed it across to him and smiled as she did so. \"Philly sent me out here with this. She said she\"s gonna have a talk with Little Joe.\" Her voice was deep and kind of rough, but in a gentle, motherly way. It occurred to Sam that Rose seemed distant and that she had taken up knitting. And she and Hoss weren\"t even married yet! He wanted to open his mouth and ask her, but thought better of it. He nodded and went to take a swig of the water. \"Do you want to go ride around and cool off? I can watch the herd.\" Rose proposed. Sam liked the idea and thanked Rose as he rode off. He knew he needed to contact the gang. He knew that they were hiding out in the old Rail House nearby. So he rode. He rode at a steady trot most of the way, so he could get there before noon. When he arrived, Sam tied his horse in the woods nearby and ran across the open field to the Rail House. Up on the porch he knocked three times, the signal. The door opened and Sam was jerked inside. In the coolness of the abandoned building, Sam had to wait for his vision to adjust. While he did that, he slapped away the hand that had jerked him. \"I know how to walk!\" He exclaimed. The rough laugh of Cash drew his attention. \"Course you do, Son. But you ain\"t walkin\" fast \"nough.\" His rank breath caused Sam to close his eyes for fear of watering. He sat down and propped himself up against the wall and exhaled. About seven men sat around him, all which remained of the once glorious gang. It used to be that the gang was made up of forty plus men on any odd day. But hangings had cut that number by more than three quarters. \"What\"s goin\" on outside?\" Cash asked. Then Sam opened his eyes and they shone with anger. \"You let Sandy and Injun out didn\"t you?\" He asked. Cash caught his breath. \"Yeah, and they ain\"t come back yet.\" He narrowed his eyes. \"Why?\" \"Because I killed them both. They were raping the daughter of my employer. I had to.\" Though he had known who the men were, Sam still hadn\"t given up their names. If he had, then all the other information about the gang would soon be revealed and that included the fact that HE was involved as well. Cash picked him up by his collar and flung him across the room. Sam crashed into a smaller man named Whimper and a bunch of metal rails. The metal bruised his back and caused Sam to gasp for air. Whimper pushed the younger man off. \"And WHO gave YOU the RIGHT to kill off my BEST killers?\" Cash roared. He pounded over to Sam again. When he picked up Sam a second time, a piece of paper fluttered to the floor from the Water Satchel that was still in Sam\"s hand. Cash ordered the only educated man aside from Sam to read it out loud. He cleared his throat. Philly looked at Hoss and smiled. Her older brother was sitting by her bed reading to her stutteringly. He had never been an avid reader, but Philly always forced him to. She told him that was because she wanted him to be able to read his children to sleep. And Hoss accepted that answer, though usually grumbling. \"The...d-d-d...ayn...jerrrr...oh....uuuss....\" Philly smiled. \"Dangerous.\" She corrected and Hoss looked at her thankfully. \"The dangerous wolf att...attaaaa...attaaaack...oh! Attacked the un...sus...pec...t...ing...unsus...pecting...unsuspecting dog. More wolves followed him and the dog struggled...\" Philly smiled. \"Very good.\" Sam\"s throat itched as Cash held him against the wall of the room. He could barely breath. \"Dear Sam,\" The man began reading. Sam shuddered involuntarily as he realized that the letter was from Philly. \"I want to thank you for saving me. I know that Little Joe doesn\"t trust you, but I do. Unfortunately, Little Joe has asked the Sheriff to search up your records to see if you are a criminal. He has this foolish idea that you are involved with the bank robbery. I guess what I want you to know is that I trust you. Yours truly, Philly.\" Cash turned his face to Sam. \"You\"ve been getting\" in close with those Cartwrights, haven\"t ya?\" He growled. Sam opened his bright blue eyes wide. His vision was flexing in and out of darkness. \"Maybe we could use you as a bartering tool. Or this Philly. I\"m sure they\"d let us ride out without any lawmen on our tails if we had this little girl with us...\" Sam realized through the growing fogginess in his brain that Cash meant harm for Philly. He also realized that Cash was going to kill him. And what good would he be to Philly if he was dead? \"I\"ll do it...\" Sam choked out. His face was turning blue and Cash was smiling his tobacco rotted smile. Cash loosened his hold on Sam, letting him drop to the floor. Sam stayed on his hands and knees, gasping and choking. He looked sideways up at Cash. \"Damn right you will. You\"ll go back to the Ponderosa and kidnap Philly and bring her to us. She might be...hehe...a real treat.\" Cash hinted and laughed loudly. Sam lowered his eyes to the wooden floor and sighed. How was he going to get out of this? Alright, that\"s it for now, and I hope that you enjoyed it. Umm, I\"m sorry it took so long to update. PLEASE REVIEW! Two months passed and Sam still hadn\"t made a choice. He had been back to visit the gang a few times, helped them rob a young politician once, but other than that stayed at the Ponderosa. He would go out riding often, most the time Rose would cover for him. Turned out Rose wasn\"t expecting like Sam had initially thought. But Philly grew bigger. Joe never let up on Sam, still certain it had been Sam who wronged his sister. One day, after riding around to cool off, Sam came back to the Ponderosa walking his horse. He needed to move, get his blood flowing through his body so he could think. He couldn\"t take Philly to the guys. He knew that. But he also couldn\"t betray them. They were his brothers, in a twisted way. When he tied up his horse in the barn, he sighed heavily. He couldn\"t... \"Kirby!\" Ben Cartwright took wide strides to meet the young man. Sam took a deep breath and held his head high. He couldn\"t let on he knew anything about the gang. \"Yes, Mr. Cartwright?\" Sam asked, wiping his hands on his jeans. Ben smiled for a moment. \"Where you been, Sam?\" Ben asked, crossing his arms. The man wasn\"t too tall, but there was an air of dominance about him. No one would want to be on Ben Cartwright\"s bad side. \"Rose took over for watchin\" the herd, Mr. Cartwright. I went to ride off some steam before I came back here.\" Sam gulped. Now that he was saying it out loud, it sounded like a schoolboy excuse. His eyes searched his hands as he wrung his hat. Ben raised an eyebrow, searching for something in Sam\"s face. \"Well, it\"s never a good idea to bring your anger home with you. And I can guess that you must be pretty fired up.\" Ben let a small smile creep into his voice. Sam looked up in surprise. Little Joe must have told the patriarch his theory. \"Mr. Cartwright, I-\" Sam began. \"Ah, ah, ah.\" Three staccato bursts of air stopped Sam in his tracks. \"There is no need to defend yourself. I believe the story you told us. Little Joe has always had a temper. He\"s not that renowned of a fighter, \"cept with his sword. I would be glad that of the three, you\"ve got Joe against you.\" \"Mr. Cartwright?\" Sam said, his eyes downcast. He needed to talk to someone. Maybe, just maybe, Philly would be that person. She had been the one to send him the letter. \"Could I see Philly please?\" \"Philly? Kirby wants to see you.\" Adam announced through the door. \"You decent?\" \"Course I\"m decent, Adam.\" Philly snapped. Outside the room, Adam looked down at Kirby. \"You sure you wanna see her now? Somethin\"s put her in a bad mood.\" He warned. Sam took a deep breath and nodded. He had to talk to her. \"I think it was Joe, he came in there rantin\" about how he was gonna avenge her or somethin\". They got in a fight.\" Adam continued as he walked down the hall. Sam turned to the door. \"Philly?\" Sam asked as he slowly entered the room. Philly was standing in front of a full-length mirror, tying her hair back. She was dressed in riding clothes. Sam looked at her for a moment. \"Where\"re you goin\"?\" He asked. She didn\"t even turn to look at him. Instead she walked over to her bed and began putting her boots on. \"Close the door. If you\"re comin\" in, come in. If you\"re leavin\", leave.\" She snapped. \"Look, Philly-\" \"Philedelphia.\" Another harsh snap. Sam\"s face knit together. What was her problem? \"Miss Philedelphia, I\"d like to talk.\" Now Philly\"s head popped up. Her green eyes glared right into Sam. \"Well, ain\"t that nice. Talk. That\"s all anyone around here seems to think I\"m good for now, talkin\". Like I\"m broken just cause I got a baby now.\" She growled. Sam looked at her belly. It wasn\"t much grown, but enough that he could tell. She had taken one of her father\"s pairs of britches to sneak out and ride in. Sam felt something stir inside him, like the truth was bubbling to get out. \"Look, Philedelphia, We don\"t all look at you that way.\" \"You don\"t? Well you\"d be the first, Sam Kirby. I live in a house full of men with only one other woman for company. All those men see me as a child already, and now this? I\"m a broken, unwanted woman who has lost all worth to any man. And my baby is already cursed to the same fate and she ain\"t even been born yet!\" Philly exploded. She stood and looked Sam full in the face. \"You should have let me die out there. What were you thinking?!\" Pent up anger roared in Sam\"s ears. He narrowed his eyes. \"Are you kidding me? I risked my life to save yours. I am still gettin\" heat from your brother over all this. And you wanna blame me for your misfortune? I don\"t think so, Philly.\" \"My name is Philedelphia!\" \"And I\"ll call you whatever I darn well please. I owe you nothin\", Phil, nothin\"!\" \"If you had left me to die I wouldn\"t be in this mess!\" Philly shouted, pointing her finger in Sam\"s face. A notion ran through his mind to slap her hand away, but he restrained himself. He had not hit a woman yet in his life and didn\"t plan to. \"If you would have just listened to your father and brothers you wouldn\"t be in this mess!\" \"Oh, here\"s that old speech again! Just because I\"m a woman I HAVE to listen to the men around me!\" \"If you\"re gonna sit and bit-fuss about what happened because you didn\"t listen, then yeah.\" Sam said, calming down. Philly\"s eyes filled with tears. She sat down on the bed and cried. Sam, unsure what to do, sat beside her. He patted her on the back awkwardly. \"I\"m sorry, Philly...delphia. I didn\"t mean to-\" Sam apologized. Philly leaned into him, still sniffling. \"Don\"t.\" She cut him off. \"It\"s my fault for getting so worked up. I, I\"m just goin\" crazy bein\" stuck up here all the time.\" An idea popped into her head and she sat bolt upright and wiped the tears from her cheeks. \"Sam, could you take me out for a ride?\" A flash of Cash\"s face raced through Sam\"s mind. He sighed and then smiled at her. \"Sure, I know a perfect place for a picnic.\"", "\"No, Lanos. One death would make things worse. We must talk to them.\" Aya countered. His hind leg still tender, Razer sat a distance away. He examined the circumstances. Behind the mob of humans he noticed their still smoldering campfire. He looked around and found a pine branch. The idea was moving his legs before he was actually considering it. The wolf crept silently away from the two arguing dogs and behind the mob to the fire pit. The pine branch in his jaws, he rested its needles in the ashes, stirring them a bit. He was suddenly aware of how exposed he was. All it would take was one human to turn around and see him, then he would be dead, as well as the others. The small flares bit lazily at the plant. \"Come on, come on,\" He growled. There it was, a solid bite. \"Hey!\" A human voice shouted. Razer\"s eyes flew to the crowd, frustrated to find few coming toward him. Just as they were close enough to grab him, the fire roared. Razer\"s swung his head instinctively, showering the humans in ashes. Fire burned bright from the branch in his jaws. All the humans hushed, terror in their primitive hearts. The old man, Myglom, appeared at the front of the crowd. He fell to his knees, fear forcing his strength into his mouth. \"Oh, great Fire Wolf! We did not know! We would never have-\" But Razer\"s rage burned a hole in his heart. He snarled viciously. \"Silence!\" He rasped through the splintering wood. The crowd cowered. Then it hit him. They thought he was a god... He could use this. \"You have angered me, my rage will scorch you all.\" His voice was deep and gravelly. \"Please, Mighty Rirnef. God of justice and anger. God who gave us fire!\" Myglom called out. A woman wailed at the back of the pack. In awe, neither Kilowog nor Hal moved from their boulder. \"We beg your forgiveness, we were only planning a sacrifice to you and your brethren. We did not know that you would come to us.\" \"That is why I have come to you, fool!\" Razer snapped, crunching the branch in his teeth. \"The sacrifices must stop! A dark time will fall upon the forest soon,\" Razer went on, only this time, it was different. His eyes stared off into space and his tail rose of its own accord. His voice dropped even deeper. \"Mankind can no longer be at war with life around him. Stop the sacrifices or suffer the consequences.\" His posture returned to normal and his eyes cleared and focused. The old man bowed, and his people followed suit. Razer dropped the piece of wood, leaving it to burn and padded around the people to the boulder. \"It is safe now.\" He barked in his normal voice. Hal and Kilowog, broken from the spell, jumped down. The sky was beginning to grow lighter. Razer waited for the dogs to take the lead and followed them obediently. Once they were out of earshot, Kilowog turned on the wolf. \"Wait, why are you following us? We can leave you back there now that they won\"t torture you.\" He growled. Razer turned his muzzle to avoid the spittle from the larger dog. \"Because I would like to amend my mistakes...I would like to join your cause.\" He murmured. Kilowog\"s eyes widened in surprise and he looked to Hal, along with Lanos. Aya\"s eyes remained on the wolf. Was he lying? They all waited for their alpha to make his decision. Finally, Hal opened his jaws to speak. \"He is coming with us.\" He said softly. \"Back there, you put yourself in harm\"s way to save us. I trust you.\" \"Well I don\"t.\" Kilowog growled. Razer smirked, casting a glance at Aya. The she-dog tilted her head in a questioning look. What was he doing? \"By the way, where\"s Goggon?\" Hal asked after a moment. Skip A few days later, the scruffy dog awoke to a snapping branch. He looked around, horrified to find himself surrounded by humans. \"No! You no take Goggon back!\" He snarled as viciously as he could. But a man with a kind face stepped out of the shadows and knelt before the dog. \"No need to fear. We will not hurt you. We want to feed you and care for you. You will never go hungry again.\" He crooned. Goggon\"s eyes drooped. \"But Goggon, so...tired.\" He growled before passing out. The man rushed forward to catch him, then scooped him up in his strong arms. \"If you sleep instead of eat you will die.\" He muttered, scratching gently at the dog\"s ear. \"Come on. We will bring Myglom his new dog.\" He commanded to the others. \"But why did Myglom want a dog?\" A teenaged boy asked. He had recently married into the tribe and did not know their customs well. \"Because a dog is a man\"s wolf. And Myglom has changed our tribe to the Fire Wolf Tribe, instead of the Death Spider Tribe..\" The man explained. Skip Back in the valley, the she-dog wandered. She could not remember. The only word that came to her mind was razer, and she did not know whether it was her name or someone else\"s. She looked around, her ears searching through the dark afternoon light. Had she been wandering in circles? She could smell canine, but it was stale. Had dogs lived here? Instinct took over. She sat down. She needed to find her pack. Her head slowly tilted to the skies and an ancient voice lifted from her being. At first it was scratchy and sour. But as she cried, her voice began to tell a story. I\"m lost. I\"m here. Hey guys, I know this is the first time I\"m talking to you! Wah! Anyway, I\"m wondering if you have any suggestions. As you can tell I\"m deviating from the script on a lot of things, but what things do you want the same? What cool concepts have you been thinking about? I\"d love to hear it all. Just review. And, each review equals the number of chapters that I will have, so the more reviews, the more chapters! Thank you all for reading, Sonoma signing out, peace! \"Are we done walking yet?\" Razer asked, irritation hot in his growl. Kilowog and Lanos, each walking on either side of him, huffed loudly. \"Do you ever not complain?\" Lanos growled. A smirk rippled across Razer\"s muzzle. \"I\"ve never seen you annoyed before, mutt. It looks awful on you.\" He joked. Kilowog, even more annoyed than the smaller dog, shouldered the wolf heartily. Razer stumbled, wincing when he hit his still sore leg. Aya, who was trailing behind them, looked up at the conflict. Her eyes met for a moment with Razer\"s, a smile flitted across her lips, her tail swayed of its own accord. The wolf huffed and turned back around, concentrating on the path ahead of him. Lanos looked from the wolf to his sister, who was still focused on the Red Fang\"s back. Curious, he picked up the pace to catch up with Hal. \"What\"s up, Lanos?\" Hal asked. \"It didn\"t sound like Kilowog was being too rough with Razer.\" The dog joked. Lanos looked back for a moment, then at the path. \"No, he was exhibiting just the right amount of roughness in his treatment of Razer. But I am worried about my sister.\" He growled. Hal looked over at the slightly younger male, a look of amusement in his deep brown eyes. \"Oh, yeah? What seems to be the problem?\" The mixed breed wondered. \"She...seems to be...noticing the wolf.\" He stammered, unsure how to word the predicament exactly. Hal\"s amused look disappeared into blank awkwardness. \"Oh, um...well...sometimes females...they, uh, need...attention sometimes. Maybe-\" He stuttered. In all honesty the dog knew almost the absolute minimum of females. \"Where exactly are we going?\" Kilowog\"s voice interrupted. Hal, relieved, turned to look back at the big yellow mutt. He stopped, taking in his surroundings. They had traveled far in the past few days. Now not only pine trees made up the forest around them but broadleaf trees which broke into clearings frequently. They had stopped on the verge of one such clearing. \"Well, since we now know that the Red Fangs are recruiting by force, we need to track them down, we need to build our own pack along the way.\" Hal replied, his half-baked plan finally in the open air. Kilowog\"s jaw dropped. \"What? You know Ganthet has to send in reinforcements. We can\"t train our own pack.\" He snarled, the idea of usurping the power of the humans forcing his hackles to rise. Hal\"s lips curled up, his tail rose into the air. \"You want to challenge me? I am the alpha Ganthet appointed, and my decision is what we act on.\" He spat. Kilowog\"s own docked tail lifted above his back. His wrinkled face opened to show his lethal fangs. \"Well I think that Ganthet made a mistake, pint-size. Why should you be alpha, huh? You have nothing special about you.\" His voice rose. \"So that\"s what this is about. Why do you always beat around the bush?\" Hal chortled, his paws moving of their own accord. He began to circle the larger dog, Kilowog\"s own bulk happily complied. \"You don\"t think I\"m good enough. You think that because you\"re so much stronger you should be alpha.\" \"That\"s what an alpha is! The strongest in the pack! And for some reason you hold the rank.\" He stopped pacing. \"Ganthet didn\"t know the problem he was makin\" when he made it. But I\"m gonna fix it.\" Before the two could leap at each other, Lanos leapt in the middle. \"Please! No fighting. We\"re all just hungry. We should take a hunting break.\" He pleaded, his tail between his legs and his ears flat. The young dog knew he was an omega, and two alpha\"s fighting was bad, especially if one died. He had to make peace. \"A successful hunt will clear our minds.\" And ensure our trust in one another. He thought hopefully. Both Hal and Kilowog relaxed at the omega\"s words. \"Yes, a hunt would do us some good.\" Hal agreed. He swung his nose to the air, searching for the scent of prey. Aya discovered the scent first. \"There is a Roe buck to the east, upwind right now.\" She reported. Hal wagged his tail once. \"Can you keep up?\" He asked Razer. The wolf bared his teeth. \"Of course I can.\" His blue eyes blazed. \"Good.\" Hal barked and leapt into action. He allowed Aya to lead until he, himself picked up the scent. From that point on Hal lead the charge. Kilowog\"s muzzle was aligned with Hal\"s left flank, but not in a challenging way. Right behind him, Razer kept pace, his injured leg only skipping a stride or two. Aya and Lanos brought up the rear. \"You ready, sister?\" Lanos yipped, adrenaline flowing through him. Aya, not allowing herself to get caught up in the thrill of the hunt, nodded to her brother. The scent became stronger and stronger. Finally, they were only a few hundred feet away. Their pace slowed. Aya and Lanos branched off in opposite directions, setting themselves up to be the ambush. \"Kilowog, you and Razer will strike at the left side, got it?\" He ordered. Razer nodded but Kilowog worried his muzzle. \"Hal, your ears must be loose. I ain\"t gonna depend on this runt to watch my back.\" The larger dog growled. \"You don\"t have much choice. If you want to eat, you will hunt with the pack.\" Hal scolded. Kilowog nodded, still dissatisfied. The wolf and the dog went around left and waited. Behind the buck, Aya and Lanos panted, waiting for the signal. Hal broke the brush, rushing the buck. Panicked, the prey ran straight toward Aya and Lanos. They readied, waiting. When the buck was near enough, Aya leapt out, frightening the buck so that it swerved left. Razer leapt out, his trajectory aiming him right under the beast\"s chin, but Kilowog leapt a second later. The larger canine slammed into Razer, knocking the wolf off course. Kilowog\"s jaws found the soft throat and he quickly closed on it. Razer hit the ground, rolling to a stop. The wolf looked up from his dizzy landing to see Kilowog shaking the life from the buck. A growl rose in his throat, but he clamped his jaws shut. Hal rushed to the carcass and lowered his head. \"In brightest morn, in blackest night, No evil shall escape my sight. To those who oppose Goodness\" light, beware my power, A Green Fang\"s fight!\" He growled. Razer watched curiously. \"That is your oath?\" He asked, once Hal had finished and the pack had begun eating. Hal, chewing, looked up. \"Yeah...oh. I suppose Red Fangs have a different oath.\" Hal realized. Razer nodded as he laid down, waiting his turn to eat. \"Yes. Ours is...not as comforting.\" Razer replied. How had he not heard the Green Fang oath before? Had they really not hunted as a pack since they had joined together? \"So, Razer. I know it\"s been a few days, but...what exactly happened back with the Spider Tribe?\" Hal asked, licking his chops and scratching behind his ear. The wolf looked surprised. \"What do you mean?\" He asked, tentatively standing to approach the meal. \"You...had a moment where you seemed...not yourself?\" Hal tried to explain. \"You actually seemed like you were possessed by a god.\" \"I-I do not remember that. But then again, I was very tired.\" Razer reasoned. Aya looked up. \"But, Razer, you saved us. And you used fire. Do you remember that?\" Her voice was soft but certain. She remembered watching with Lanos from the shadows. Razer looked at her, but his focus was in his own memories. \"I-I remember waiting for the fire to ignite...but after that I don\"t remember anything...\" He finally surmised. Kilowog huffed and rolled his eyes. \"So what do you think happened? A god actually possessed you?\" He snorted. Lanos looked up curiously. \"What exactly is a god?\" He intoned. \"A god is a higher being that humans like to believe controls their lives.\" Razer growled. The pack all looked at the wolf curiously. He ducked his head down and took a bite of the carcass. Through the mess he mumbled his own oath. With blood and rage of crimson red, ripped from a corpse so freshly dead, together rise our hell-born howls, death to traitors, that is our vow! \"Razer...how do you know about human gods?\" Hal asked, curiosity killing his manners. Razer chewed and swallowed before answering. \"When I was a pup...my birth pack was disbanded and my mother, not being able to hunt for herself, left me with a human pack. She kept my two siblings...but left me. I grew up for a few months with the humans before another pack took up terf nearby. I immediately left to join them.\" He explained. The pack digested their food and the information in silence for a few moments. \"Let me get this straight...\" Hal began, but Lanos cut in. \"So you lived with humans and grew up to kill them?\" The young dog asked. \"Why?\" Immediately Razer shut down. He turned his back on the dogs and finished eating. \"Well, I guess that\"s enough.\" Hal barked after a few awkward moments. The pack members yawned and settled down near their kill. In the distance a howl rose into the air. Only Lanos and Aya could hear it. I\"m lost. I\"m here. Okay, so tomorrow I\"m gonna do something special for Easter. I may put an Easter egg from another DC comic series or just post a few chapters in one day. I\"ll decide tomorrow! Happy Easter guys! (and Passover and any other springtime holiday which you may celebrate.) Darkness lay like a soft blanket over the valley. The small pack had settled down not a few hours ago from a hard two days\" trek. Though bellies rumbled, they managed to play a little, the light gray male leading the romp with the gray female. The only two apprehensive about the interaction were the wolf and the large yellow dog with the short snout. \"Razer?\" A deep and smooth voice whispered. The she-dog turned to look at the white wolf trying to sleep behind her. His left ear was chipped from a long ago fight, his muzzle scarred from years of battle. But his blue eyes were calm and soft. The black she-dog smiled and moved toward her friend, leaving behind the pack she had been watching. \"Yes, Walker?\" She whined, rolling over in front of him. He smirked at her youth. He had only known her for a week, but already he treasured her companionship. He had spent months and months alone after his pack had been destroyed. He had heard of a pack in the Frontier Valley and had only made it there to find the valley underwater. That is where the two had met. She was lost and looking for her identity, the only clue being \"Razer\". So they had begun a journey of their own, to find a pack or a place to live. It had been the day before when they had become aware that they were following another pack. Unsure as to whether the pack was friendly or not, the two decided to keep their distance for a while. \"Are you sure these wolves are friendly?\" The white wolf asked. He was worried for the female, she was too trusting. She had immediately trusted him, something that, had he been another kind of wolf, he could\"ve easily taken advantage of. \"They don\"t seem overly fond of each other.\" \"Oh, Walker. You worry too much. Didn\"t you see them playing together?\" She tried to reason. The need to belong tugged at her being. \"I need a pack, what if these wolves are the perfect match?\" \"Razer...you know that you and I could be a pack, right?\" Walker yawned, rolling onto his side. \"A pack of two? That just doesn\"t seem right.\" She mused. She looked at him, their muzzles almost touching, and a moment passed. \"Please, Walker? If it doesn\"t work out by tomorrow we will move on. I promise.\" Walker\"s blue eyes narrowed. \"Alright. Tomorrow we\"ll go down into the valley and talk to them.\" Skip \"Razer, do you mind if I sleep here tonight?\" Aya\"s soft voice whispered in the night. The light-sleeping wolf lifted his head and looked in her direction. She faded out of the shadows into his line of sight. \"Not at all...but why?\" He asked suspiciously. The light gray dog looked down at her paws. \"Actually, I have a few questions.\" She murmured. Razer\"s ears perked. \"Ask ahead, then. I may not answer then all though.\" Razer grunted. \"Why are you still here?\" Her first question was direct, catching the wolf off guard. \"Well, I have nowhere else to go. Atrocitus certainly wouldn\"t take me back, not after helping your pathetic little pack.\" The wolf snarled. Aya smiled and sat down, her tail neatly wrapping forward. \"It is your pack, as well, Razer.\" She woofed calmly. \"Why are you so easily angered?\" \"I have great rage in my heart, dog...Aya.\" He corrected, calming himself. Just looking into her hypnotic green eyes embarrassed him for his behavior. \"But you can lose that rage, can you not?\" Her voice was soft, Razer felt his heartbeat slow, then his mind registered her question. \"No...it is not that simple.\" He growled. \"If it was do you not think I would have let it go sooner?\" \"Well, I had always assumed that you wanted to be angry.\" She growled softly, her head tilting in curiosity. Razer huffed in amusement. \"No. I know this anger is going to be my death. I know it is slowly eating up what little of a heart I have left.\" \"Can I help?\" She asked, standing and moving toward him. Immediately Razer recoiled. He had not eve brushed fur with another wolf outside of battle since he had lost Ilana. He was not about to start. \"You can leave me in piece.\" He gruffed ad turned his back to her, laying down to sleep. She stood there for a moment. \"Oh...\" She muttered quietly. After a minute more of silence, she turned back to the others, laying next to her brother. \"Oh.\" Skip Walker was running. The sky all around him was dark, dark blue. But there were no stars to illuminate his path. Suddenly trees sprouted up from the ground on either side of him, their line coming closer and closer. They were all around him. A tree sprouted up under his paws. Desperate, Walker leapt, just barely clearing the tree. He landed already rolling, everything around him disappearing into a blur. When he stopped, he looked up and saw his pack. There they were, alive and healthy. But a large red wolf leapt on them all, swallowing them whole. Walker cried out in anguish as the red wolf howled. From the red wolf\"s mouth a canine figure slipped. It rolled across the ground to rest at Walker\"s paws. He looked away for a moment to see the immense red wolf disappear. A squeak drew his attention to the animal at his feet. It was the black she-dog. Her tail thumped once before she leapt to her paws and ran. He followed, everything around him a blur again. An abrupt collision stopped him. His muzzle smarting, he looked up to see a great deer of some kind. The antlers were enormous, arcing out over the dwarfed white wolf. Behind the deer stood the black female, her green eyes blazing. She and the deer opened their mouths to speak, their voices twining around each-other\"s. \"Wake up and find Mogo.\" Skip Walker jolted awake, his breath labored and his tongue dry from panting. Above him stood Razer, a look of concern on her face. Behind her the sun was high in the sky. \"Walker, are you alright?\" She barked. A smile spread across his muzzle as he sat up and shook his anxiety away. \"Yes...wait, why didn\"t you wake me? I must have slept half the day away.\" He yawned, stretching himself out and relaxing. \"The pack left before dawn, so I figured I\"d let you sleep. By the time you started panicking, I couldn\"t wake you at all.\" She explained, still worried. \"What were you dreaming about, though?\" Walker became serious. \"We have a new mission, I believe.\" He muttered. \"We must find an elk named Mogo...\" Sorry there was so little canon in this chapter, I will get back to it, I promise! I just needed to set up a new arc. You have any questions, just put them in your comments and I will answer you."]}

She prayed that it would be a son, a strong boy who would avenge the possible fate of his father. She would have to be strong now, just like the Queen. She would have to be strong and never abandon hope, although she knew that hope was forsaken in these lands. But she loved, and that gave her hope. I For an instant, Delena could see the day of their first meeting. The king\"s guard, led by their captain, Astinos\" father, were on a procession through the city of Sparta, introducing their newest member. Artemis was so proud that his first born son had been accepted into this deadly squad of warriors. Each of them had successfully completed the agoge, and only few of those who were put through it survived. The aim of the agoge was to physically and morally steel the men to serve in the Spartan army, men who would be the walls of Sparta since there were no defensive walls. Lycurgus had given the order to have them taken down many centuries ago. This new one, a handsome but strong young man, had just completed the krypteia, the patrolling of the helot land plots with only a spear or knife as protection. Only those who survived it were give high standing in the army and potentially became a part of the three hundred knights. They were Sparta\"s finest soldiers, ready to give everything for their king and country. And now there was one fine man more. Delena had accompanied her father, Dilios, and now stood on the side when the men passed. Dilios, as he always did, gave a little nod when he walked past his daughter which made her smile. And next to her father there walked a shy, brown haired man, broad shouldered, his dark brown eyes carefully examining the surroundings. And when Dilios greeted his daughter, that young man turned and looked at the woman his comrade was greeting. Delena smiled warmly at the stranger and he smiled back. His eyes lit up when their gazes locked and the young woman suddenly felt a strange attraction towards him. This night, Dilios brought the young man and his father, Captain Artemis, home with him. \"Daughter, prepare something to eat. The Captain and his son will join us today.\" He said with a laugh when they came through the doorway. Delena knew Artemis well, but she had never seen his son before today\"s procession through Sparta. She bowed to both, her hands grasping the sleeves of her peblos, the exercise robe which were open on both sides. \"Captain, welcome! And welcome to you.\" She smiled at the young man and then turned and headed to the kitchen room. She did not dare to make her look at the captain\"s son last longer than appropriate but she saw that the young man smiled a little and bowed as well. His red coat fell to both sides of his muscular body and when he straightened upright, Delena thought to see a blush on his face. When she returned some time later with a decanter of wine, Artemis stood up. \"This is Astinos, my first-born. I\"m proud of him that he finally got chosen to be a part of Spartans finest army.\" While Astinos shook his head embarrassed, the captain embraced his son. That was a nice gesture, Delena thought. To her mind, it was always a good thing when the sons returned from the krypteia alive and not crippled. She moved a little closer, nodded her head towards the young man and lifted the heavy decanter made of marbled clay to refill the empty cups of the three men. Astinos hurried to help her and the girl could not help wondering. Mostly, the Spartan men were kind but did not get involved in the household chores or the business of raising children. Delena was not shy, but she knew when to restrain herself. She had learned reserve and formality from her father early in her life. She had been trained as was appropriate in Sparta, she had received an education involving dance, gymnastics and other sports. Similar to the agoge that the Spartan boys had to go through, the girls were put through this training to bear healthy and vigorous children and still be graceful creatures. But even though Spartan women were strong and powerful, Delena knew when it was better to leave men to their talk without interrupting. Like a beautiful shadow she moved, filling the cups, bringing more cushions. Dilios was proud of how devout his daughter was and said so to the captain. When she walked past with the decanter, Artemis alleged that she would give birth to many strong and fearless sons. With a delighted smile, Delena bowed, thankful for the acknowledgement. She cast a shy glance at the young Spartan who sat to his father\"s right, and noticed that he was staring at her. Careful that none of the older men noticed, she returned the smile she saw on his face. Then she left again for the kitchen and began to prepare the meals, she heard the men laughing in the main room. When she remembered the shy glance from Astinos, she had to smile. The girl went to the anteroom to get the salted meat, lamb, and olives. Then she mashed wheat and mixed it with water to make fresh bread. She heated oil in a pan and fried the dough until it was of a golden brown colour. The aroma was carried out of the kitchen into the other room from where she could hear the men calling for the delicious food. It took her a few more minutes to arrange the food on the platters and then catch her breath. The presence of the stranger was almost unbearable but at the same time pleasing. For the first time, she was confused by her own feelings. \"Daughter! What takes you so long? We are starving!\" she heard her father\"s impatient voice. \"Bring on the food.\" Quickly, Delena brought out the tray and placed it on front of her father. It was customary for the man of the house to break the bread and share the meat. With a nod of his head, he handed some of the still warm bread first to Artemis and then to Astinos. Both men took it with great gratitude and then also offered their gratitude to Delena. She smiled and then retreated with a bow to bring more wine. Even though Spartan women were allowed to eat and drink in the company of men, even soldiers, she never did. She never wanted to. It was only a few days later when they met again. Delena had just finished the daily training routine at the dancing halls near the king\"s quarters and walked past the main road when she saw the young man talking to a few of the others. Stelios, one of the King\"s best men next to the captain, brushed back his long light brown hair and gave Astinos a nudge to the ribs. Delena blushed when both men turned. So Astinos must have told Stelios that he had visited her father\"s house the other night, or it must have been his father\"s doing that Stelios knew about her. Of course, because of her father Dilios, Delena knew most of the other men and they knew her. She kept walking until she saw her youngest brother Demian playing with his friends in front of the white house in which the chamber of council was. They had wooden swords and pretended to fight each other in a hard battle. Hopefully, the old and wise men weren\"t in a meeting right now. She knew that they hated any kind of disturbance and interruption. Suddenly, she heard footfalls behind her and the children stopped playing and stood dumbfounded and wide-eyed. Delena turned and looked into friendly brown eyes in a soft face framed by long black hair. Astinos smiled. Demian, being bold in front of his friends, dashed forward with his wooden sword raised high as if to defend his sister. Delena tried to catch him but he was too fast and just wouldn\"t listen to his sister\"s breathless words. Astinos smiled again and waved one hand. \"Let him have his try...\" he said and unsheathed his own sword which was by far longer, broader and sharper than Demian\"s sword made of wood. The boy hesitated. Demian was only 6 years old and would be taken into the agoge on his seventh birthday next year. For that, Dilios had sent him to an early training that might save his life during the krypteia, the time in the wilderness, and also trained him at home, as was custom in Sparta. With another motion of his hand, Astinos made the boy come closer and fall into combat stance. The other boys still stood awe-struck on the marble steps of the council chamber. But then, after a few moments of silence, all of the young boys there began to yell \"Attack!\" and Demian shot forward. From what Delena could see, he fought just like her father. The same movements, the same posture, the same way of holding and handling the weapon. Wood struck upon metal, one light blow followed by a heavy one. The force of Astinos blow pushed the boy back and Demian fell to the ground with the sword still in his hand. \"Fight with your head and heart and not only with the strength of your arm.\" Astinos advised him. \"You are strong and bold, my friend!\" The boy blushed and smiled a little before he ran back to Delena to hide behind the folds of her peblos robe. When Astinos came closer, Delena bowed. \"I\"m sorry, my lord. My brother is young and inexperienced. And sometimes, he can be quite a nuisance.\" Astinos smiled again. \"He is a good fighter. He will make a strong warrior.\" \"Thank you, my lord.\" She bowed again and then turned to go. Demian had already taken off with his friends. Obviously, the noise of the playing and the little fight with Astinos had drawn out a few of the councilmen who were now complaining about the distraction. With a demure gesture, Delena bowed and drew back. She knew that the old men would not do anything because they were proud of the Spartan children. But one man, middle aged with a robe made of white and blue to indicate his high status, seemed to feel very offended by what was going on outside. His face was hard and his brown eyes were cruel and Delena didn\"t like the way he looked at her. Then she felt Astinos putting his hand on her shoulder as if to protect her from the frightening glances of that man, Theron, the spokesman of the council. He would not have dared to speak up in front of the councilmen, but his mere presence as one of the King\"s guard was enough in this situation. Theron turned away with his fellow councilmen and disappeared into the shadows of the council chamber. Delena turned around and looked into Astino\"s brown eyes. \"Thank you, my Lord.\" \"I am sorry, my Lady. I know your father does not like Theron, the councilman, much, as does my own father. I did not mean to interfere.\" Delena smiled a little and inclined her head. \"There is nothing to forgive. My father told us to stay away from the council chamber but as you can see, the boys never want to listen. They get themselves in trouble all the time.\" \"They are the future of Sparta!\" Astinos said proudly, but at the same time he had to admit that he suddenly felt as if something was missing. He knew that his father had had his first son, Astinos himself, at his age now. He also knew that Stelios, his best friend, already had two strong sons, and Stelios was only a couple of years older. It was common to have children at an early age, as was marriage after the krypteia, which was stressed highly in the Spartan society. But nonetheless, a Spartan man\"s life was entirely dedicated to land and army. \"May I walk you home?\" He suddenly offered. Delena looked at him, her green eyes sparkling. But she kept her reserve and said nothing. \"I\"ve kept you far too long, my Lady. Your father may be worrying so I take it as my duty to bring you home safely.\" The young woman couldn\"t keep herself from smiling. \"Duty?\" But she stepped forward. \"Then I won\"t stand in the way of your duty.\" Astinos flinched a little. Duty always came in the way. But he held out a hand which with another smile she took. II \"Father, please.\" Delena whispered when Dilios took her hands, his head hanging low. \"There is nothing I think I can do, precious. Not even the king could change that fate.\" The fair haired man stroked his daughter\"s long light brown hair. \"But do not fear, nothing is decided yet.\" His voice carried a deep sadness so that Delena couldn\"t keep in the tears. She started to cry so that even brave and strong Dilios had to take in a few sharp breaths to calm himself down. He hated to see his daughter in such grave sorrow. But yes, nothing was decided yet. But the Ephors had at last announced that they would soon take their new oracle. And Theron, spokesman of the council, had come to choose from the most beautiful virgin maiden of Sparta. It had been the day of her first encounter with Theron that her father brought home the worrying news that the spokesman of the council would supervise the trainings for the time being and also choose of the young woman and girls from the city to show at the training hall near the king\"s quarters. It had also been the day of Astinos walking her home from the dance routine. And now, nearly two weeks later, Theron had announced the initial stages of the selection of the new oracle. That was why he had been watching the trainings so often lately. Her father Dilios, a close comrade of King Leonidas, had to watch helplessly when Theron looked very closely at the young women assembled in the great audience chamber. Delena had been one of them. All of them had to wear white robes and Dilios had flinched every time when Theron stepped in too close that he could almost touch his daughter. It had hurt the Spartan to see his daughter there, presented on stage like a piece of meat for sale. It had happened quite often during the last years that the spokesman of the council chose the virgin oracles for the Ephors. Right now, nothing was decided yet. Theron had made a collective choice of four of the young women, Delena being one of them, and was - today - on his way to the hill on which the priests lived. Dilios had never seen them himself, but he had heard rumours, and so had Delena. The Ephors were mean creatures, men but no men at all, faithful but cruel. The Spartan knew that his daughter was very frightened, even though she tried hard to hide it. She had always been strong, of heart and mind, as were his sons but he was worried about what was going to happen to her, in case the Ephors chose her. Dilios was a man true to his faith and he - as all the Spartans - believed in the oracle but taking away the only beauty of his life meant taking away life itself. Delena\"s mother, his beloved wife had not survived the death her last born son. Delena was all he had and that was why he was scared to lose her also. He knew very well that he could never argue against the decision of the Ephors. He was helpless. Delena had been his first-born, and even though he had always thought that he could never love a daughter so much, he had quickly changed his mind. Then his wife bore him 2 sons and died at giving birth of a third. The eldest son, Dosta, had already undergone the life-or-death training out in the wild while the second son, Dichos, had just been taken away. Dilios himself had gone through it and came back a better and stronger warrior. Dilios always had a personal dislike towards Theron, so had his daughter. As long as possible, Dilios had tried to protect Delena from the political and religious struggle and had kept her away from the daily routine of the Spartans, but now he could do nothing more. To prepare her for life, he had taken her with him as often as possible when he had to meet with the king\"s guard. But once, only this once this one day, she had crossed paths with the spokesman of the council. Dilios now blamed himself for not teaching her to always steer clear of priests and politicians. But it was too late now, or so Dilios had thought. Delena tried to stay as calm as possible during the next few days, always aware of the changes that were going on around her. Her father was absentmindedly and ordered her to always stay close to the house when she was not doing her daily chores at the training halls. A few of the girls that had been chosen with her had already disappeared and everyone knew where to, although no one would have ever let slip any thought like that. Astinos, whenever allowed, spent time with her, accompanied her to the daily trainings, met her at the official dances and finally, admitted his feelings for her. She felt honoured that he would choose her because she had heard rumours of his father planning to choose the bride himself. It was only then Delena found out that she had been the choice all along. It had been some sort of understanding between Dilios, her father, and Astinos\" father Artemis. She had tried to keep the news of the decision away from Astinos but his father, being King Leonidas\" right hand, had known about it from the very first day. But even though Astinos had learned about it, he did not show his very own concern. He was sure that Delena already had enough reason to be concerned. But deep within, he felt as if he would be loosing something very important if the ephors chose her. He should have never let himself feel so much for her, he realized now. But love was a strange thing, it came in the way whenever it felt necessary and it did not care about situations and circumstances. Delena had thoughts of her own. She had never felt so close to anyone before, and even though it scared her a little, she knew that it was simply a normal reaction. But under the given circumstances she felt as if her life had been turned upside-down. The decision of the ephors came closer and closer and every moment she spent with Artemis\" son made her feel as if finally, she could feel complete. She knew that to love a Spartan man meant to love a warrior and always be aware of the danger that lay ahead. Death was everywhere. She also knew that the Spartans were the best fighters with the best techniques but still, death awaited them all. But this fear made her realize that she really loved him, with all her heart. And that made her aware of what to do... A few days later, Dilios returned from the King\"s house and when he stepped through the door, he found his daughter sitting on the floor, crying, her face smeared with blood, her white robe stained with blood as well. He rushed over to her and pulled her up. \"What happened?\" he said breathlessly. Delena flinched in his tight grip but it was only when he saw the knife in her hand that he let her go. \"Child, what have you done?\" He sank to his knees in front of her and embraced his daughter. \"What have you done...\" He cried, but suddenly he felt so relieved that he started to laugh hysterically. He pushed her back a little and put his hand against her bloody cheek. \"What have you done, precious?\" Finally, Delena spoke up. \"I wanted to save myself...\" Dilios looked at his daughter and smiled despite the tears. \"You are a clever one, although I\"m not sure if that helps your fate, but we will see.\" He got back up on his two feet and pulled his daughter up with him. \"Let\"s get you cleaned up.\" Dilios sent Demian for the healer and once the blood had been washed away, Dilios could finally see the wound that his daughter had inflicted upon herself to save herself from being chosen as the oracle by the Ephors. The cut went from just beneath her right eye across her cheek to her fine jaw line. But nonetheless, Dilios thought, she would be beautiful. The healer now put a mixture of herbs and oil on the wound and carefully bandaged the cut with white linen. \"It won\"t take long to heal but there will always be a scar...\" she said and patted Delena\"s shoulder with a thin and withered hand. The old healer did not ask where this wound came from but the look she gave the girl\"s father, both knew that the healer knew. But Dilios was sure that she would not go around spreading these news. III Delena stood at the front doorway of the old and empty festival building, looking out onto the stonework balcony where there was nothing except free winds tossing through a red coat and through strands of black hair. The young woman smiled slightly at the tall man standing a few paces away from her. \"I prayed you\"d come...\" \"Astinos!\" Delena said quietly when she moved towards him, but he heard the unmistakable joy in her voice. The man took a few steps towards her and held out his hands. When their hands touched then, both looked deeply into each other\"s eyes and smiled. But they could only restrain themselves for a short moment, then they fell into each other\"s arms. Then the black haired and brown eyes Spartan pushed her away a little, lifting one hand to caress her cheek, softly touching the scar that was still visible on her soft milky skin. And as every time, he sighed. He knew that she had to do it to save herself from the cruel fate that would have awaited her. But deep inside his heart, he felt that she had only done it to be able to stay here with him. It\"s been only a few weeks since the incident, and the wound had healed well, the scar was still there. He had never asked her why she did it and he never would, that he had promised himself. He would never question her or any of her actions. All he could do was to hold her and be happy she was with him. And for that, he thanked the gods every single night. But he also knew that he could never return the kindness when they marched into war. And war was close. From what he had heard from his father and his friend Stelios, a group of Persian messengers had arrived at Sparta to demand the submission of", "In the last weeks they had come a little closer than they ever had before. They had shared a room for at least a week, because Munder had grown terribly sick and Murphy didn\"t want Dodge to be sick, too. So it was an easy decision to have Munder sleep in another room. Santos had a room for himself, and everyone refused to sleep there because it was devastatingly smelly. Murphy and Greer each had a single room, too. There were only two beds in the room where Munder and Dodge used to sleep, same for the room of Epps and Ceil\u00ed. To have Munder sleep in a single room then meant either moving out for Murphy or Greer, but for Murphy being the captain, Greer had to leave his room. The First Mate started to complain that he couldn\"t and wouldn\"t sleep in a room with Dodge, and before there was more arguments and even a fistfight, Ceil\u00ed had intervened. She offered Greers to share a room with Epps, which he gladly accepted, and moved her stuff into the other room. Sleeping in one room didn\"t make it easier for him. His secret passion for her didn\"t let him sleep at night and when he slept, he had weird dreams. It were really weird dreams and he was scared that she could hear him in the night. He could lay awake for hours just watching her sleep, and imagined how it would be holding her close. He secretly wanted her to feel the same but up to now she never signaled anything to him. He sometimes couldn\"t work correctly because of her being around, and that was why Munder always poked fun on him. Dodge didn\"t care. All that he wanted was to be with her. Getting ready The wind was blowing into their faces and Epps and Ceil\u00ed had to push back strands of hair more than just a few times. It was already dark and hard to see, although both headlights were running at full power. Santos had just spotted a strange anomaly on the radar, and Murphy thought it could be the ship that they have been searching for. The mist grew thicker and it started to rain heavily, and suddenly Santos screamed from the lower deck. They hadn\"t even time to react before the Arctic Warrior collided with something that just hadn\"t been there a second ago. Dodge, who was standing near the left headlight, was thrown overboard by the impact and could catch a towing rope just in time. His head was knocked against the planks and suddenly felt all-dizzy. There was no real pain but he knew that he couldn\"t hang on any longer. Ceil\u00ed sprinted over to him, not caring about the movement of the ship to help him. She stumbled over a metal can and hit the plank hard. But she didn\"t care, as well. With a split lip she ran over to Dodge and caught his arm to tuck him back aboard. It was quite a hard thing to do, for he was a well-built and sturdy man. But in her fear she managed to grab him and pull him over the reeling. He was angry and frightened, it showed quite obviously on his face when he now rubbed his throbbing head. But it lasted only a moment, for when he saw Ceil\u00ed\"s injuries, he quickly pulled her into his arms and led her back to the others. The girl didn\"t refuse to be held that close and seemed to enjoy his warmth. Epps was shocked to see the girl in this state. Her face and shirt were soaked and already stained with blood. Yet the cut on her lower lip wasn\"t bad and she was already grinning again. \"Damn, Santos, why didn\"t you stop before we hit this piece of shit?\" Ceil\u00ed squealed and slapped him on the shoulder. The spanish man looked at her. \"Sorry, hun!\" he panted and tilted his head to the side. \"What is this...\" they heard Murphy draw in breath harshly. Dodge had gone over to the headlight again and let the light trail over the metal rump of the huge ship. There it was, the name of the ship. Murphy slowly read it. \"Antonia Graza...\" he whispered. \"Antonia what?\" Munder spoke out aloud what all the others thought. \"\"These Italian liners, they couldn\"t compete for speed, so they built these floating art palaces instead. She was reported missing on the 21st of May, 1962 off the coast of Labrador. Funny thing is, there was no distress signal, no contact...she just disappeared, she was gone. Ever since that day, every captain and his mother\"s been looking for her, hoping that she hasn\"t gone down.\" ~*~ Ferriman was extremely excited to see the ship, but none yet wondered about this excitement. Epps and Murphy both gaped in awe at the ship, Munder and Dodge were a little disgusted. \"She doesn\"t look like one of those pretty babes...\" Munder muttered, being nudged by Dodge who pulled a face. \"You know what? I can even remember the headline in the newspaper. My dad showed it to me when I decided to buy my first tugboat. He said that I should keep my eyes on a ship like that. \"Built in 1954, the majestic ocean liner Antonia Graza was the pride of the Italian Line. A vision of modern, sleek sophistication, the ship was nothing less than a work of art. Amenities provided for her passengers ensured that they would enjoy unrivaled luxury during their stay at sea; when guests were not unwinding in their spacious staterooms, they could socialize in one of the stylish lounges, enjoy sports and relaxation atop the liner\"s broad decks, or take a refreshing dip in the stately swimming pool. The centerpiece of the Antonia Graza was its opulent grand ballroom, where couples would dance the night away to the romantic strains of a live orchestra. Chefs labored night and day in the galley preparing superb Italian cuisine to be served in the ship\"s elegant dining room, and attentive crewmembers were always available, eager to provide their guests with anything they should desire. It was truly the journey of a lifetime.'\" \"Ah...\" mimicked Munder. \"So then why is she here? I mean, it\"s been 40 years since she disappeared, isn\"t it? And why is she right here, more than a thousand sea miles off any navigation route?\" \"If only I know...\" Murphy sighed and went inside. Munder, Dodge and Ceil\u00ed followed him. Epps and Ferriman lingered on outside, she being fascinated by the ship, he being fascinated by her. Becoming more daring, he stepped in close and offered her a cigarette, which she gratefully took. Her eyes were tied to the eerie ship, only being a little aware of the staring eyes of Ferriman who read her thoughts like words in a book. Tales and Truth Ferriman was sick. He looked really sick. He looked like death warmed up and he was close to throwing up. Ceil\u00ed moved a little farther away from him. There was one thing that she really hated, and that was the smell of vomit. Dodge watched her and offered her a place beside him, but she ignored him and cuddled against Santos, who was busily studying the plans of the Arctic Warrior. The main engine wasn\"t working correctly after the crash with the huge ocean liner. The Spanish man almost slapped himself across the forehead when he realized what he would have to do. It was only a small thing to fix to make the ship stabilize until they could repair it. They would need a lot of metal to close the holes in the outer hull. And they would have to patch up the Antonia Graza to tug her back to Anchorage. He wasn\"t that convinced if their small boat could tug such a huge ship, but Murphy was so damn sure of it all. \"Ey, preciosa!\" he grinned and put an arm around Ceil\u00eds shoulder. Dogge watched them with rising suspicion and was close to hitting himself for this stupid kind of jealousy. He knew that for Santos, the perfect girlfriend was his Cadillac. There was nothing more valuable in his life besides this car and he always took care of it like it was a baby. Well, at least whenever they were home in Anchorage. Ceil\u00ed seemed to feel his intense stare and smiled at him. But this smile made it even worse. It was such a hard time for him, to sit there and pretend that everything was ok, when all he wanted was to touch her, kiss her and feel her. \"The captain of the Mary Celeste was Benjamin Briggs, 37, a master with three previous commands. On November 7, 1872 the ship departed from New York with Captain Briggs, his wife, young daughter and a crew of eight. The ship was cargoed with 1700 barrels of raw american alcohol bound for Genoa, Italy. The captain, his family and crew were never seen again.\" Murphy said. \"But the ship was seen several times ashore before Tripolis.\" \"That\"s a lot of booze...\" Greer grinned. The crew sat around the little table in the social room, listening to what he told them. \"Ghost ships...ah, this is ridiculous. There is always a rational explanation for it!\" Munder muttered. He hated supernatural things, so he had decided long ago not to believe in anything like that, always avoiding such things. \"You know what this sounds like? Bullshit!\" Dodge grinned but when he saw the expression on Murphy\"s face he shut his mouth immediately. Murphy glared at him. \"I\"ve been out there before you were born, Dogde.\" \"I know...\" \"And I\"ve seen things even more strange than this.\" He paused and Ferriman stood up. \"Then why don\"t we go and see what\"s up there?\" he said with a strange edge in his voice. Epps looked at him and back to Murph. It was as if she could read his mind. He wanted to look around the ship, of course. So did she. There was something mysterious going on and she had no clue what it was. But she wanted to find out, that she knew for sure. Outside the rain had stopped and the moon covered the ship in pale light. It was just enough light to see where to step without stumbling to the ground. \"Like I said, she looks like shit!\" Munder whispered and Dodge laughed. Murphy threw an angry glare at them and both quieted immediately. Ceil\u00ed carried the flashlight and went first, Dodge followed closely, always prepared to grab for her if something unexpected should happen. They found the bridge and the logs but nothing explained why she was here, where the passengers were and what the bloody hell happened on board this ship. They split into three groups, Murphy and Greer, Epps and Ferriman, who had been allowed to come after quarreling a lot, and Dodge, Munder and Ceil\u00ed. Santos had stayed back on the Arctic Warrior to fix the front engine. Ceil\u00ed did not want to be alone on the Arctic Warrior but she was also scared of the Antonia Graza. And when Epps and Munder sang the Love-Boat-themesong, her laugh was too loud and artificial. Greer seemed to feel the same. Ferriman walked as if he knew the ship and opened doors that no one thought to open with bare hands. But all of them were busy thinking thoughts of their own, and no one cared about the strange things that were happening. Ferriman smiled inwardly. [now the R part starts - sensuous content!] Learning Back on the Arctic Warrior, Murphy decided it would be best to go to sleep really soon. They would need all their strength tomorrow, he told them. They had walked around the ship and found nothing. But they knew that they had to fix the rudder and the breach in the hull that made the ship sink slowly. Murphy was not willing to let go of the ship, because it contained the answer to this riddle and mystery that he could not grasp. Ceil\u00ed saw that Munder was nodding drowsily and half sleep-walked to his room. he didn\"t notice that Dodge wasn\"t coming with him. Greer had been the first to leave and Epps and Murphy now decided to go, too. Ferriman who had been outside watching the ocean liner had disappeared, they assumed he had already gone to sleep. Santos, hardly being able to leave his work, muttered and left. Ceil\u00ed and Dodge soon were all alone. \"I heard you last night. You were talking in your sleep.\" Ceil\u00ed said when she caught him alone. Dodge, sitting on the couch, grew crimson red. \"Really...\" he muttered. \"Yeah...\" Was there a mocking tone in her voice? \"I also heard you the nights that we spent together in one room. I didn\"t dare to tell you then, because I didn\"t know what to make of it. Now I know...\" Dodge looked at her, she was smiling. \"Oh my good, she must have seen me with a woody.' he thought. And when she now stood up to come over to him, he had problems to keep his breathing on a normal level. She wore only a shirt, which didn\"t hide much of her long legs. His eyes were tied to her body, although he tried to wrench his gaze away. When she walked, he could see some traces of her underwear. \"Do you like what you see?\" Her voice was a faint as the whispering winds outside. Dodge could only nod, gulping down the amount of saliva that had been in his mouth since she stood up. Ceil\u00ed smiled and came even closer, almost touching him, when she now reached out with her hand. Dodge took it and pulled her close onto his lap. When she rested her head against his shoulder, she spoke again. \"Last night...you weren\"t asleep, were you?\" \"Well...\" Dodge didn\"t know what to say. \"I know. You don\"t need to explain. \"I may be this wise-cracking street kid but I know what it was that you dreamt about. And I can tell you one thing, I dream about this, too.\" Dodge turned his head to kiss her. But before that he met her eyes. There he found a passion that he had never seen before, and a sparkle that made him shiver. She stood, grasped for his blond hair. Drowsily he stood up, too and glared at her. \"Can I ask you something?\" \"Sure...\" she breathed and directed him towards the table that was standing in the middle of the room. \"What is it?\" \"Is Ceil\u00ed your real name?\" The girl laughed. \"Are names so important?\" \"No...but...I was curious...You don\"t need to answer.\" \"I grew up as an orphan in a family that never cared much about me, so I never cared much about them. I always refused to have myself associated with the name this family...\" She pulled up his shirt and shoved it over his head. In the moment of blindness, Dodge felt her hands on his chest, wandering down to the sleeve of his jeans, softly stroking over the bulge of his erection, making him choke. He freed himself from the cotton shirt and backed away one or two steps to catch his breath. She looked down at his chest and there was an amazement to be seen in her eyes that made him feel happy that he had done workout lately. \"I was married, did you know that? This horror trip lasted less than one year, and felt like 10...You\"re so not chest out, not the usual macho-guy...\" she whispered. \"I am sorry...\" he whispered. He hadn\"t known anything about her history, yet he was kind of shocked to find out about her past. \"Don\"t be! It was my own fault, I am not gonna make it again. This is here and now...\" Her voice grew faint and quiet. Looking up to him, she reached around his neck and pulled him close. With one hand she held him close, the other hand trailed down his stomach and into his pants, undoing the buttons to push them down. He helped her and stepped out of them, pushing her onto the table. In frenzy he tore at her shirt and almost ripped it into half, freeing her breasts and tightened nipples. Another moan came through her mouth and she threw her head back, enjoying the touch of Dodge\"s skilled hand. She now was lying on the table, Dodge on top of her, softly kissing every inch of her skin. With her hands she tried to pull him closer and he followed her urging willingly. As if caught in the current, he pulled her against his erected body, kissing her roughly. She did not fight his exploring hands and did not hold him back when he fumbled on her slip. A harsh breath escaped her mouth when he pulled her panties down, letting his hands trail along the insides of her legs. There he found a heat that made his mind dizzy and when he moved his hand a little higher, he felt a sweet dampness and knew that she was ready. Wild storm *Keep your body still..* *Close your mouth, close your eyes...* *I\"m tangled up in flesh again...* *I\"m addicted to it...* *Close your eyes* Willow-Flesh Dodge stared wide eyed, at the beauty before him. Never had he seen anything more beautiful than the creature that his eyes gazed onto. \"I think...I think I\"m in love with you...\" Dodge spoke, breathlessly. \"I think I am too.\" Ceil\u00ed replied, trying to keep her heart from beating so fast. Dodge never felt like this before. He had been having casualized sex and kept it distant to keep himself free and to protect himself from the need that he now felt for Ceil\u00ed. Suddenly here was this hunger that urged him to be as close as possible to her. She seemed to feel the same. Right now there was no time to think that it might be the wrong thing to do or that she might not see this as the starting point of a real relationship, but it didn\"t matter to him in that very moment. With one hand he brushed her hard nipples and bent his head to suck at one of them, feeling the sensitive flesh frizzle and curl within his lips. The other hand stroke the sensitive spot of her clit, first one finger and then two probed against her opening. His tongue twirled around the tight knobs and massaged them in a way that made her moan and shiver. When he now moved farther down, her body bent and pressed against his own body. His tongue, replacing the fingers, found the slick entrance to her body and tasted the sweet flavour of her most intimate spot. She nearly cried out when he pushed his tongue inside, letting it spin around. She moaned ecstatically and grabbed his shoulders. \"I wanna feel you...\" she breathed and for a moment, Dodge forgot to breathe. He kissed his way back to her face and suddenly felt her hand around his own arousal, stroking up and down his entire length through his boxers. The need to feel her grew stronger and stronger and he almost didn\"t remember his own name, but he felt good. He wanted to satisfy her in a way that she had never been satisfied before. Her breathing in his ear made him go wild but he didn\"t care, all he wanted to do was to be inside her. Ceil\u00ed guided her pale slender hands towards Dodge\"s waist, slowly pulling down his navy blue boxers to his ankles. She gasped at the size of his throbbing erection, and began to feel still in time. Her body completely relaxed, but her heart beating ever faster. Dodge couldn\"t help but think...what was his future going to be like with this woman? Where would he go from here. Would he marry her? Would there be a family? Ah fuck it, all he wanted to do right now was fuck this woman\"s brains out. Carefully, he kicked his boxers from his ankles, and positioned himself over her body, slowly lowering himself down, so he was now inside the tightness. She directed his erected member and guided him inside her. \"You okay?\" he asked, trying to figure out what it felt like for her. \"Yes.\" she smiled warmly, and pulled him in for another kiss, making him fall deeper inside of her. Ceil\u00ed cooed with delight as he pushed against her walls, it stung for just a second, before it became an absolute pleasure. \"Don\"t stop...\" she moaned. Dodge began to push slowly at first, his erection building up ever faster, Ceil\u00ed whispered his name out loud. Small drops of blood fell from her opening, onto the table. They weren\"t even an inch, just tiny drops. He was a little too quick entering, Ceil\u00ed winced a little from the pain that drove through her body for an instant. But she quickly adjusted to his size and moved underneath him, trying to take as much of him as she could. Dodge didn\"t see this but Ceil\u00ed did, she felt the pain...the wasting away of her virginity, and now, she was ready for a new life...with this man... Dodge moved slow and felt the intense heat and tightness around him and also inside of him, and he knew that he couldn\"t take it slowly any longer. He would explode any second. He knew he wasn\"t doing it right, and he knew that she knew. But she smiled and pulled him close. She now moaned again and there was only the sensation of flesh in flesh, her hotness surrounding him as he thrust into her faster and faster. Faster and faster, he began to pump into her, as she held onto the table with flat palms, being pushed back into the wood, their rhythm almost equal. She kissed his shoulder, biting into the soft flesh, in utter pleasure. \"Please...don\"t stop...\" she murmured. This was all the attention Dodge needed, as he pumped faster and harder, breaking away from his crush on Maureen, Ceil\u00ed was now his future. After a few minutes of mind-blowing sex, it came to a stop, as the juices flowed, dripping down the table top, onto the floor. \"It\"s okay...let go...\" she smiled up at him, kissing his wet hot lips. Dodge sighed, fighting the urge, as he came inside of her, her muscles tightened around him, as she moaned in utter passion, Dodge collapsed on top of her, as she slowly ran her pale slender fingers through his dirty blonde hair, and they both slowly, fell into a lovers sleep. The night faded away, into dawn. The two laid, blissfully awake in each other\"s arms, and Ceili was the first to speak. \"You know...\" she whispered in Dodge\"s ear, the two wrapped in a white sheet onto of the table. \"Hmm?\" he asked. \"That was the best I\"ve ever had.\" she admitted, smiling. \"Really?\" he asked, raising a blonde eyebrow. \"Really\" she smiled. Suddenly she stopped moving. \"What is it?\" he asked breathlessly, feeling a little disappointed. \"I\"ve heard something...\" she whispered and twisted free from underneath him."]}
{"id": "61109cb6-fd36-5630-b454-6864e34e6b3f", "fandoms": ["Klonoa", "The Santa Clause"], "pair": ["Such was the calming effects of the former ruler of the Kingdom of Tranquility; the Great Priestess herself. The albino woman was clearly visible and looking through the bars when the progression passed her cell with their two prisoners. She sat on the bed, hands folded, and looking on without a hint of emotion in her face. \" It will all come to pass soon, my dear. \" It was the same blessing that the priestess offered to every prisoner taken out of the cellblock; assuring them that the worst of their struggles against the tyrant presiding over them was over. Among the members of the short lived resistance Leorina fought the most, and was the most active, driven by the need to preserve her newfound freedom from the church. For the precious few that remained free she would be known as a Hero, not a criminal, because her diversion assured that their operations had time to relocate. It was a desperate tactic that came at a heavy price ... Heading through another set of double doors Leorina came across what would become Lunatea\"s worst fear; a lone glass and metal tube sitting atop an elevated platform. The only heavy light in the chamber illuminated the tube with an eerie glow. Leorina\"s eyes darted up to the level above where a series of metal platforms were suspended close to the walls. There, in the shadows, she could see the silhouette of a familiar figure the resistance had grown to hate. That traitorous bastard! Sharp blue eyes narrowed at the two brought into the chamber this hour in consideration before instructing the sentries further. \" The filthy cat first. \" No! The Sky Pirate had forgotten about her comrade, her partner, her best friend in this world completely until she came into view again. Tat now swung by her tail, unconscious, in the cold hands of the sentry that carried her over to the opening door of the tube. The guard threw the helpless feline into the tube carelessly as her friend watched in horror. Much to Leorina\"s anguish the situation only became worst. The whirl of the machines\" gears coming to life caused Tat\"s lone eye to open just as the floor began to glow under her. Her reflexes kicked in swiftly, her body flying backwards just as the column of light began working its way up the tube, but the closed tube left no place for the little cat to run. She could only prolong her fate. Tiny claws scratched at the insides of tempered glass helplessly as Tat looked to her friend for help. Leorina couldn\"t take that look. Her own dark eyes closed in defeat just as the light came within inches of Tat\"s twitching tail. Her head bowed in silent respect when she heard her comrade scream; the last willful sound the cat would ever make. Seconds later Tat\"s body bounced off the floor of the glass chamber, completely encased in a hard coat of metal. The faint hissing of engines attempting to steady the feline\"s body upright once again ensured in the minute that passed. It didn\"t happen, and the one watching from the shadows grew impatient. \" It\"s useless if it can\"t fly. Scrap it. \" \" NO - \" Her sudden outburst was cut off by the sound of the two metal plates in the glass chamber suddenly colliding with each other, effectively crushing the metal body housed in between. The sound of the metal crumbling on impact made Leorina cringe; her knees finally giving out from underneath her. The height of the guards kept her from falling to the floor completely, so she\"d just hang limply from their arms. \" You monster ... You\"re a monster. \" Her muttering slowly grew more incoherent. The following order was given silently to spare the broken Sky Pirate anymore anguish. The guards slowly dragged Leorina towards the glass chamber. During the walk the chamber was cleaned and prepped by a kangaroo Workerbot that Leorina thought was slightly familiar. It was customary for the guards to push the prisoner into the chamber if they could wall. Leorina just fell onto her knees, catching the glass on the opposite side with her hands to preserve some dignity by not hitting her head. She didn\"t stand, pull herself to sit, or did anything to get into a more comfortable position. Her eyes were barely focused on the metal floor beneath her; staring at the last place she\"d seen her best friend alive. The traitor in the shadows spoke again. \" Any last requests? \" \" Only one. \" Her voice droned over the enclosed glass as she welled up in tears. \" I want to know why you\"re doing this; betraying your friends and brethren. Do you really think no one cares about you? \" There was a moment of silence before the answer. \" Request denied. \" They muttered shortly before the machine began to shape another Lunatean into a machine; a much more effective tool then the gears that Garlen had envisioned. While Garlen\"s original idea would have provided stronger, better lasting, units it would have taken approximately 5,000 Lunateans to make a robot the size of an average robotized Lunatean. It meant that their dictator could only make approximately a hundred robots with few replacement parts; not effective for devastating worlds. The lone figure looked on as the tube door opened again nearly a minute later; the occupant again trapped in a thick coating of metal. Leorina would be spared her partner\"s fate since her unit\"s efficiency readings were above average, probably because of her immense strength as a living being. It would take another five minutes for her to be wired into the overlord\"s network completely, in which she\"d be assigned her permanent station and dismissed from the room. Most likely she\"d work in the mines below the old Sky Temple harvesting Dream Stones and other powerful artifacts to be used as fuel. No need in theorizing about it now. The tyrant who oversaw this operation was only interested in the facts. \" Log for the Fifth Hour of the Eighty Seventh day. The prisoners of Cell 26 in Cell Block D, two females, were robotized. Prisoner A was found inefficient and destroyed. Prisoner B is running at 82 efficiency and rising. Prisoner B\"s new designation: Workerbot L-192. Proceed to Loading Dock C for shipment immediately. \" \"At once. \" The newly formed robot droned before walking stiffly out of the chamber. Eighty Seven days ago today Lunatea changed forever. Their world was invaded by a warlord who hailed from a neighboring dimension. He managed to master the art of traveling worlds and apply it conveniently to the machinery he brought along with him. Lunatea was beginning to recover from the grip of the Nightmare when the warlord attacked; their defense was practically nonexistent. Seventy percent of the population was successfully captured in a forty eight hour period. The remaining Lunateans, mainly Heroes and armed professionals, pooled their resources and went into hiding in hopes of building a resistance. Preparations went for thirty days before the group was betrayed by one of their own; a double agent who ensured they\"d be spared by giving away the secrets and location of their coconspirators. The first incident of sabotage was taken as an unfortunate accident that delayed their plans, but after five attacks came in succession the agent was discovered and forced from their ranks. It was a move that happened too late, it seemed, since the resistant had dwindled down to a few untrained soldiers who lived their lives in fear. There was one who had not given up hope even when the others did; an erratic spirit that took over once their prior leader, Leorina, was confirmed to be robotized. The young leader lacked experience but made up for it in courage and strength. He managed to successfully destroy sister-branches of the horrible facilities used to turn Lunateans into robots, and rescue some grateful citizens from certain doom. Their numbers and hopes swelled as he rallied the people to train to fight for themselves. He gave them a reason to pray to the Goddess Claire again ... ... Until the day he too was captured. Klonoa fought until he succumbed to his wounds to protect the children that he\"d been overseeing in that field. He made sure that every last one of them made it back into the burrows deep underground before leading the sentries away from the others hiding. Once they captured the cabbit they didn\"t bother to scan the area for other potential victims. The current leader of the resistance was the ultimate prize. The children told their parents of Klonoa\"s bravery in his final hours. Arrangements began immediately for two occasions. The first was an interception mission of the transport that would be used to take Klonoa to the holding cells, and the second of memorial service for a fallen Hero. Interceptions were rarely successful, so they had to brace themselves for the worst. There would be no second chance if they failed. It was eight in the evening; five months after Leorina\"s robotization. \" Retrieve Cell 16. \" The cells in Cell Block D were barren. No one escaped from the prisons once they found themselves in the block itself. Every prisoner brought into this block met their fate sooner or later. For some it came within mere hours of capture. For others they waited weeks before the number etched next to their cell door was called. They knew it was no longer up to the fate presided over by the Goddess Claire, but rather to a master computer\"s random number generating program. Four guard units entered Cell 16 to carry the physically worn prisoner from his cell. Slumped against the back of the cell shackled by wrists, neck, and ankles, was the former resistance leader Klonoa. He\"d been chained, belly to the wall, since being brought to this block approximately one month ago today. The back of his shirt was torn; littered with telltale whip marks that told of his days of \"interrogation\". Klonoa groaned in pain when he fell from the wall seconds after being freed. His wrists were caught by two guards standing opposite, and his ankles were lifted from the ground as well. It was done by the orders of the presiding machine operator who feared that the former resistance leader\"s ankle was sprained during their last interrogation session. The same figure stood in the shadows of the platform when the guards brought Klonoa into the all too familiar chamber. \" Klonoa of the Wind, you have been convicted of treason against our Empire. The mandatory sentence for your crimes is immediate robotization and deployment. Do you have any last requests? \" In all honesty the shady figure thought that Klonoa was incoherent from the weeks of brutal beatings by several sets of hands, including their own. Surprisingly, the cabbit breathed a shaking breath before responding. \" Y-yes. \" His typically youthful voice cracked from the pain of a damaged windpipe. \" I ... \" The cabbit\"s head lifted to peer into the shadows with what little strength he had. \" I want to see you smile. Just one more time. \" His request was an unusual one. Normally people did everything from damn their name for their treachery to asking for a meal, a drink, to smoke, or some vile act that need not be repeated. Most requests were granted simply because it was the honorable thing to do, but this one made the shady figure hesitate. \" ... Fine. \" The response was soft, and was followed by a step meaningful footsteps to position themselves in a ray of light so their entire body could be seen from the glass chamber. Their attire was different from the years that they knew each other on much friendlier terms. Employees of the Empire were required to wear slate gray and military green uniforms. Months of watching allies, friends, fellow Lunatean\"s lives be destroyed took their tool on a once youthful face. It was now sharp, apathetic, and uncaring shortly before thin lips curled into a rare smile. Klonoa, in return, smile seconds before being pushed into the waiting glass tube. His paws steadied himself to stand even though his legs were shaking. He again looked up towards the figure in light with that same smile on his blood stained face. \" Thank you ...\" The sound of the machine beginning the process nearly drowned out his final words. \" I\"ll miss you. \" Thin fingers clutched the steel railing at those sentimental words. Through all the selfish moves that they made these past few months they could not deny what they knew to be true: I\"ll miss you, too, Klonoa. \" ... Log for the Eighth Hour of the Two Hundredth and Twenty Second day. The Prisoner of Cell 16 of Cell Block D, one male, was successfully robotized. Prisoner is working at 91 efficiency and rising. Prisoner new designation: ... Workerbot K-129. Proceed to Loading Dock A for immediate shipment. \" \" At once. \" For some reason it pained them the most to see the lack of life and personality in that voice more than any other Lunatean they subjected to the process. Lunatea was completely devastated by the effects of their active dictator within a year. Scanners indicated that within seventeen months of the original invasion there were no signs of life outside of the main complex built over the former Kingdom of Sorrow. Every Lunatean on the planet, except for the traitor, had either died or been robotized at a rate that astounded even their dictator. The double agent was kept around not only because they did their job effectively, but because the tyrant needed a young living being to oversee the many facilities. He did not want to conquer Lunatea alone. His job was not finished when he stripped this planet of its people and resources. Of course it wasn\"t. His intention was to build up a strong army of workers and fighting units so he could invade his home world in the same fashion. From there he would systematically conquer every world that he comes across. Fortunately his plans never went into motion. The tyrant died in his chambers of natural causes in his sleep fifteen years after the complete destruction of Lunatea. He personally requested for his turncoat to come for one final meeting, mainly to keep him company. Through the dense pollution that came past their filters, he spoke; \" This world was founded on the emotions of living beings. In just a year I managed to turn it into a world of inorganic life our of those very same emotions. I destroyed this planet in hopes that I could solve past problems, and failed. \" He gripped the traitor\"s hand tightly. \" I tried to take revenge on my world because I thought no one cared ... but then I realized that the very ones I wanted to attack were the ones who originally saved me from my own kind. They were not my enemy, but I made myself theirs ... \" \" You too turned on your people because you think they hated you. They do not. I assure you they don\"t. Even in the final days of the resistance they wanted to save you, rehabilitate you, and cleanse you of your sins. It is not too late ... This world, this Empire, and all of the people in it I leave entirely to you. It is not too late ... to do what is right. \" The grip on their hand slacked. Another year passed since the tyrant\"s death, and the air of Lunatean had grown too thick for any living creature to breath. The traitor found themselves constantly wearing an oxygen mask and goggles so they could still function. Tonight they were on their last oxygen tank. There were more down in the storage chambers, but they didn\"t make a Workerbot fetch one. All of the workerbots would be needed for their final task. A disk was placed in the central computer of the steel facility, and the double agent gave their last verbal command. \" Computer; initiate sequence R.E.B.I.R.T.H. Turn on Firewalls 02-53. Run backup sequence 38 if original sequence stalls. Continue original sequences until all tasks are completed with 90 to 100 satisfactory ratings, then run sequence S.L.E.E.P. \" \" Processing request ... \" The computer hummed in a monotone voice. \" Request received and cleared under Security Article C2. Initiating R.E.B.I.R.T.H. sequence ... \" Seeing those bars run across the screen, one after another, brought a rare smile to the turncoat\"s lips. It was a true smile that remained when they sat down in that chair, savoring their last minutes of oxygen. \" Sequence R.E.B.I.R.T.H. complete; Initializing S.L.E.E.P. sequence ... \" The robotization process was originally not meant to be a method of punishing prisoners. It was originally developed by a creature from the tyrant\"s planet by the name of Charles for medical purposes. Theoretically it was possible for a creature to be perfectly preserved in the process; healed from injuries that would otherwise destroy an organic body. In theory well maintained robots could survive for hundreds of years only to be restored to their original state upon derobotization; a process that had not been made public ... ... Not until recently. The workers throughout the planet were ordered to return to the main Prison Blocks that were used to robotize the majority of the population for \"maintenance\". From there they were escorted, one by one, to the very chamber that they\"d been turned into machines in hundreds of years ago. From once where organics became machines, only to become organic again in a way that brought tears that could not be held back. Families, friends, and lovers were reunited in a way that they couldn\"t even if they worked in close quarters with each other since robotization. They could once again touch, feel, and express emotions that were hidden under a metal exterior. In metal form they were not completely lifeless. That is a common misconception. They were aware of their surroundings every day they spent in their robotic prisons; they just couldn\"t do anything about it. Their electronic brains were hot wired to follow commands against their will; an experience none who survived wanted to relieve or wish upon others. Just like that the war of the Nightmare was over, and the dictator that plagued them was becoming a distant memory. Through the prior centuries every robotized Lunatean took place in project R.E.B.I..R.T.H.; the gradual restoration project that affected the entire planet. Plants were grown to renew the air quality, and old factories once used to create machines of war were converted until plants to better clean the air and water. This planet was made livable through the work of the survivors; an ideal they were all grateful for now that they can enjoy it. The only standing monument of Lunatean\"s downfall was the main facility located in the Kingdom of Sorrow, which was no longer a desert region. Once all of the surviving Lunateans were derobotized the facilities would be sealed off, but not destroyed, to be an eternal monument of their struggle. One curious cabbit made a final sweep of the steel corridors he\"d been tortured in during foreign rein. He was curious about one small factor that the others seemed to overlook; the ultimate fate of the one who betrayed them all. There was no doubt in anyone\"s mind that the double agent was dead; either killed by their master or dead from the inhabitable conditions the planet fell into years ago. No records remained of the traitor being robotized, and no trace of them could be found after derobotization. It seemed that they simply disappeared. Klonoa\"s search brought him to the main computer; still functional even all these years due to workerbots maintaining it right up until derobotization. His curiosity peaked, and he tried to access the files in the computer. The moment his fingers graced the keys the screen reacted, though, flickering black before displaying white lettering in small font. A letter ... To Whom It May Concern; If you are reading this letter today I assume that project R.E.B.I.R.T.H. and project S.L.E.E.P. were successful. To this world that viewed me as a corrupted traitor I give my final gift; a second chance at the kind of life that I would never have. Let me explain my actions in simpler terms. The moment that Jillian attacked I knew that the battle was not in our favor. Many lives would be loss if we were left to fight the enemy head on, so I did the most dishonorable thing imaginable. When I myself was caught by Jillian I pleaded with him to spare me. In return I would tell of all possible tactical resistance operations once I returned to the field. I obeyed his commands. Not because I had to but because I knew that it was the right thing to do. If the Lunateans were robotized it meant that they could be derobotized later. It was a process I learned about from Jillian himself. I immediately began work on coding the two final sequences after officially defecting to the Empire. I worked in secret during the odd hours where no prisoners were robotized. I ensured that as many of you as possible would survive the toil of working for the Empire, but could not save you all ... For those I did save I wish them the best in a world that can live freely; in a way that this little caged bird could never live. My title, my life, my sins; I leave them all behind as I stand before the Goddess Claire to await my eternal judgment. May the Goddess have mercy on my damned soul; Lolo. The End Raise your hand if you thought the traitor was Guntz. :D", "\"Yeah...except this one exploded.\" \"Ah...,\" \"Yuki?\" \"Yes?\" \"Do you remember the time when you made that...bonfire? The one you made behind the workshop, just before Christmas Eve last year?\" Bernard asked curiously. \"Oh, yeah!\" Yuki cried excitedly. \"It was freezing that night. So I ran back into the workshop and found a room filled entirely with paper! Can you believe that? So I said \"Lets Burn it!\" Pretty soon, I had a nice big fire Burning outside. Everyone sat around and told stories and roasted chestnuts and marshmallows...it was great,\" Yuki sighed, smiling at the distant memory. \"Then, there was a lot of commotion...and the rest...well the rest is a bit fuzzy...,\" Yuki lied, looking away nervously. \"Is that right...and do you remember what I said to you that night?\" Bernard sighed. \"Yeah...you told me that Santa\"s List had been stolen...and you thought it might be a prank by some of the younger workers...but,\" She paused. \"Where was Santa\"s List that night, Yuki?\" \"Well...,\" \"Well, what?\" \"That magic paper really kept the fire going...,\" Yuki laughed nervously. \"At least it made everyone happy.\" She added optimistically. Bernard sighed irritably. \"You see? No Accident! She did it on purpose.\" Bernard accused, turning to Santa. \"I did not! Now was I supposed to know...,\" Santa sighed momentarily. \"Bernard...as you are well aware of...Yuki is different from the rest of us...,\" \"She\"s Human.\" Bernard corrected. \"I know...and I know how Human girls at her age can get...,\" Yuki\"s eyes widened. \"What\"s that supposed to mean?\" She asked curiously. \"What would you know about Human girls?\" \"Enough to know that they\"re completely insane.\" Bernard said with a dead serious expression. He turned to Santa. \"Santa...she\"s Sixteen years old. That\"s when it\"s at its peak.\" Santa looked at him Curiously. \"I don\"t think I quit follow...,\" \"The Craziness! That\"s what I\"m talking about.\" Bernard explained. \"The only crazy one is you.\" Yuki murmured. Bernard leaned into Santa to whisper. \"And I read somewhere that some girls her age like to do the strangest things to get attention...,\" Yuki heard everything. \"Hey! What exactly are you getting at?\" She demanded. \"You don\"t think I\"m doing all this on purpose, do you?\" \"Aren\"t you?\" \"Huh?\" Her face flushed with anger. \"I can\"t believe you!\" Santa Laughed. \"Now, Bernard, let\"s be reasonable.\" \"Yes, Lets all be reasonable, and say that seven hundred and fifty three accidents, caused by one person, in the past ten years do NOT just happen by Accident. It\"s no Coincidence!\" Bernard pointed out. \"Wow...you actually counted?\" Yuki asked. \"Yes, I counted!\" Bernard yelled. \"I\"m the Head Elf around here. If I don\"t keep up with what goes on in the workshop, than who will? It\"s my job to assure that the Elves are safe. I can\"t have you stalking around, blowing them up!\" \"I\"m not Stalking!\" Santa smirked. \"Perhaps you\"re over exaggerating the matter just bit...,\" Santa brushed the matter aside. \"Now then, I think we\"re quit finished. There are much more important matters to attend too. Whatever the damage may be, I\"m sure it can be repaired...I think its best you forget about Yuki...,\" Gritting his teeth, Bernard suddenly slammed his fist into the corridor wall. \"Listen to me!\" He shouted impatiently. His voice echoed down the hall. Every elf in the Corridor, including Yuki suddenly fell silent. There\"re eyes locked in a cold stare. \"Ever since your father died...the real Santa...The Santa I knew...I\"ve found it very, very hard to except you as our new leader...,\" Bernard went on. \"Ever since you\"ve brought this girl into the North Pole, it\"s brought nothing but chaos! These obvious feelings you have for her, if that\"s what it is, have gotten way out of hand! You casually brush everything aside, every time, like it\"s nothing! And I\"m sick of it...The Santa I knew would never put his elves in Danger. The Santa I knew...,\" \"The Santa you knew is Dead!\" Nickolas said dryly. Santa\"s golden eyes burning into his. His pale futures appearing calm. \"Whether you like or hate me...I don\"t care,\" Santa admitted. \"But...you will respect me. I\"m your leader now. I made an oath to protect the Elves the same as my father...and you.\" His expression softened. \"Bernard...?\" Santa said suddenly, \"You\"re right...,\" \"Nickolas...?\" Yuki whispered. \"No.\" Santa silenced her. \"And it\"s my responsibility to fix it.\" Santa went on. \"Bernard...these past ten years, you\"ve showed great leadership over Yuki. Thank you for all your work.\" Bernard beamed with pride. \"I\"d like you to look after Yuki,\" Santa said suddenly. \"From this day on, she\"ll reside at your residence.\" An eerie silence drifted through the corridor. \"WHAT?\" Both Yuki and Bernard shouted. Yuki clutched onto Santa\"s suit. \"B-but...Nickolas! I...I can\"t!\" \"Santa! What do you...but do you really mean...?\" \"Yes.\" Santa smiled charmingly. \"I want her to stay with you until I return...,\" \"Return...?\" Yuki asked desperately. \"Your leaving?\" \"Where are you going?\" Santa only smiled. \"Where I go, is only for me to know.\" He replied. \"The only thing you need to know, is that it\"s very urgent that I leave tonight... There is something I need to know...It\"s very important that I find the answer myself.\" Bernard and Yuki looked both Stunned and Curious. \"What do you need to know...what are you talking about?\" Yuki asked curiously. Santa looked into her eyes, smiling fondly. Silky strands of Silver hair draped over his shoulders, as he leaned down to caressing her cheek gently. \"Yuki.\" He said warmly. \"I need you to be strong for me. Can you do that?\" Yuki blushed. \"Okay...but...I really don\"t want to live with Bernard!\" \"You\"ll be fine. I trust Bernard.\" He assured her. \"Um. Excuse me?\" Bernard interrupted. \"I don\"t mean to interrupt here, but Yuki can\"t stay with me. Santa...please re-think this! She can stay with another Elf. Not me...,\" \"It\"s been decided.\" Santa said sternly. I trust that you\"ll make my little Yuki here comfortable until my return?\" Bernard sighed. Utter dread washed across his face. There was no way out of this. He realized. \"Yes, Santa...,\" He finally replied with a sharp glare. \"I\"ll try to make her feel as comfortable as possible...,\" \"Good.\" Santa replied, Smiling brightly. \"I\"ll send for her things.\" Writer Comments: In in case you havn\"t noticed. Santa isn\"t your average fat old dude with a white beard and Hair( Honest, It made it hard to take the story seriously) He\"s younger and better looking. I thought it would apeal more to younger readers, and makes an intresting change. You be the jugde:) I made it my own. That\"s what a real writer does. And Yes, Bernard is a little Angery in this story...but maybe he\"s angry for a reason? Ever think that? Keep reading:) Please review. Critiziom makes a better writer. Bad comments, good comments. It\"s all the same :) Thanx Bernard cursed under his breath, trudging through the icy walkway, just outside the workshop front gates. Yuki struggled with a large suitcase at the front steps of the workshop opening, a few feet away. \"Wow...this...is really heavy...,\" She groaned between exhausted breaths. \"I already offered to carry it once, but you said \"No I\"ll be fine by myself\". So I\"ll ask again,\" Bernard said. \"Yuki, would you like me to carry that for you?\" Yuki huffed, wiping away a drop of sweat from her forehead. \"No. Really! I\"m okay,\" Yuki assured him. \"You\"ve done so much for me already. The least I could do is carry my own bag. Really, I\"m fine.\" Bernard sighed. \"If you insist...,\" \"Aaaaaaah!\" She screamed, sliding down the icy steps, and landing on her ass. The suitcase went flying into the air, slamming hard against a nearby Christmas tree. \"Yuki!\" A huge pile of Snow slide off one of the branches, and rained down over Bernard\"s head, knocking him to the ground. Bernard groaned, sitting up to brush the ice from his dark curls, and placing his Green Beret hat back on his head. He ran to her side. \"Yuki? Are you alright?\" \"Ouch...,\" She groaned, rubbing her sore bottom. \"It was an accident officer, I swear...,\" She said in a daze. Bernard leaned down to help her up. At that same moment, Yuki stood up quickly, bumping him in the nose again. \"Ouch!\" He yelled, holding his nose painfully. \"Bernard! Your nose! Are you okay?\" Yuki squealed, clasping her hands over her mouth. When he pulled his hand away, there was a small drop of blood. Yuki panicked. \"Oh no! Bernard, you\"re bleeding!\" She placed her face in her hands. \"That\"s the second time I\"ve done that today! I am so sorry!\" \"It\"s okay. It\"s just a little blood. I\"m fine. Forget about it.\" Bernard assured her. \"Let\"s just get out of here, before you break somebody else\"s nose.\" He grabbed her by the hand and pulled her down the walkway. Dragging her heavy suitcase across the snow, Yuki frowned, her face flushed with embarrassment. \"I\"m really sorry for everything. I know it must be a huge burden to take me in like this. But it\"s not like I\"m doing these things on purpose...,\" She sniffed. \"Are you crying?\" Bernard asked alarmed. \"No, just a cold.\" Yuki answered, rubbing her nose. \"Look, I\"m sorry about what I said earlier, okay? Don\"t worry about it.\" Bernard assured her, with a long sign. \"Just try to stay out of...,\" ACHOO! Yuki sneezed hard, throwing her off balance. \"Whoa!\" She bumped into an enormous Candy cane pole, which just happened to have a tiny crack in its side, causing it snapped completely in half. It tumbled forward and hit the next Candy cane pole in line, causing that Candy cane pole to snap, which led to the next ones destruction, and the next one, and the next ones. They fell like dominoes, all the way down the street to where a very elderly elf, surrounded by a dozen elves, who watched in amazement, as he skillfully, sculpted a beautiful colossal Ice sculpture of a polar bear. Elves screamed, diving out the path of the last enormous red and white Candy cane. The Elderly sculptor, deaf of all the commotion, after hours of hard work, slowly climbed down from his finished masterpiece. CRASH! The Icy Polar bear sculpture\"s head was knocked off from its shoulders, into the air. And then SPLASH! Right through the frozen lake behind it. The Sculptor slowly turned around to admire his work...but realized its head was missing. The poor old Elf, clutched his hair in frustration, and screamed. \"...trouble...,\" Bernard finished his sentence, his face drained pale. Yuki laughed nervously, rubbing her nose. \"It was an accident waiting to happen...,\" Yuki snuck around the traumatized audience, as Bernard Casually assured them that it was an accident, and the damage would be repaired shortly, while the angry Sculptor\"s bellowed crude remarks in his right ear. Bernard sighed, catching up to Yuki a block away. \"I...,\" Yuki began. \"Don\"t say anything! Just walk.\" He ordered, pointing ahead. He was far from used to these types of accidents... \"Bernard?\" Yuki asked doubtfully. He didn\"t answer for a few minutes, but she went on anyway. \"Are you alright? Besides all that commotion just now...Earlier...you really lost it today. I mean, the way you yelled at Nickolas, and all. You should really watch what you say. You know, you could really get into trouble. What if got fired? Who would take your place?\" Bernard smirked. \"Fire me? Yeah right. Do you have any idea how long I\"ve been the Head elf? He\"s barely out of dippers, and has the nerve to call himself \"Santa\"? He\"s almost your age. \" He said truthfully. \"Nickolas is a great Santa!\" Yuki said offensively. \"So what if he\"s a little younger than most Santa\"s. He still does his part every Christmas Eve just the same. All the other elves like him. So what is it with you?\" Bernard rolled his eyes, and groaned allowed. \"What about you? Every time he\"s around, you\"re practically drooling over him.\" Yuki blushed. \"I do not! I have nothing but the highest respect for Nickolas. If it wasn\"t for Nickolas, I wouldn\"t be where I am today...and he\"s been so nice to me ever since then...,\" \"Save the Soppy story\"s for somebody else. I don\"t want to hear it again.\" Bernard said irritably. \"Can we just drop this topic already? The walk\"s not that far. Come on.\" He walked ahead. \"Fine then, Mr. Grumpy pants,\" Yuki said sarcastically. \"Why are you in such a bad mood today, anyway?\" \"Aside from the obvious?\" He remarked sarcastically. They soon came to a very large house, only a block down. It stood two stories tall. It was enormous! \"Wow!\" Yuki exclaimed, gaping way up to see the green shuttered windows overhead. \"Bernard...you live here?\" \"Well, yeah. You didn\"t think I lived in the Workshop, did you?\" Bernard asked skeptically. Yuki looked away, embarrassed. She did. \"Of course, not.\" She lied. \"I just never really thought about it...I mean..., you never actually leave the workshop.\" \"That\"s because I\"m always working.\" Bernard said. \"Being the Head Elf isn\"t as easy as it looks.\" \"I can only imagine. Being grumpy twenty-four-seven can\"t be easy.\" Yuki said absently. \"When you\"re working twenty-four-seven, being grumpy is acceptable.\" Bernard replied. \"Between working as the Head Elf, and babysitting you. It\"s a wonder I haven\"t gone completely insane.\" As they trudged up the snowy walkway, Bernard escorted Yuki to a dark-green painted door, with a bright red bow hanging across the front, and opened it to let her inside. A pretty elf, with short ivory hair and crystal-blue eyes, stood smiling in the doorway. Her eyes lit up when she noticed Yuki. It was Sana.Yuki\"s best friend. \"Sana, is that you?\" Yuki shouted enthusiastically, \"Here, hold my things!\" She told Bernard before dropping her heavy suitcase without looking. Before he could catch it, it landed on his foot. \"Ouch! Yuki!\" Bernard scolded, rubbing his foot painfully. Yuki gasped. \"Oops. Sorry...,\" Bernard sighed. \"It\"s okay.\" Sana looked surprised. \"Yuki? What are you doing here?\" Yuki hugged Sana tightly. \"It\"s so nice to see you again. So this is where you live. I had no idea you were Bernard\"s girlfriend!\" Bernard and Sana both blushed. \"Um. No, Yuki...Sana is my housekeeper. She works for me.\" Bernard explained blushing deeply. \"And no...she\"s not my girlfriend.\" \"Oh...,\" Yuki muttered. \"Yuki\"s going to be living with us,\" Bernard told Sana. \"Unfortunately, you know Yuki as well as I do, possibly even better.\" His expression was serious now. \"Please...I\"m begging you...please keep an eye on her. The last thing I need is my house burned to the ground or exploded into a million pieces. I need you to guard this house with your life. Do you understand me, Sana?\" He told her wide-eyed. Sana Smiled at him. \"Really, there\"s no need to worry, Bernard. Yuki isn\"t as bad as she seems...,\" CRASH! \"Oops...,\" Yuki muttered, standing over a large pile of shattered glass down a long hallway. \"Somebody broke that...Bernard, I think your house is haunted...,\" \"You\"re the only paranormal thing in this house.\" Bernard groaned, standing over the unrecognizable shattered object. \"That vase was older than I am!\" \"Oh...,\" Yuki stared up at him blankly. \"Than...it must have been ancient.\" Bernard groaned irritably, rubbing his temples. \"I have a headache. Sana? Take her to the room furthest from mine, upstairs. Yuki? Make yourself at home, but do NOT touch anything else!\" \"What about the floor?\" Yuki asked curiously. \"Yes, you can touch the Floor.\" \"What about the Air?\" \"Yes, you can touch the air.\" \"What about this?\" Yuki asked, poking at a framed picture hanging on a nearby wall. Coincidently, the glass shattered, and the frame fell to the floor. \"Um...somebody broke that too...,\" Yuki said, laughing nervously at Bernard\"s irritated expression. \"Don\"t touch anything else...,\" Bernard said bitterly. \"I\"m going to lay down now. I\"ve had a very long stressful day.\" He turned and walked all the way down the hall to the last door, and slammed it shut. Sana smiled warmly at Yuki. \"Hm. That went well.\" Writer Comments: This Chapter was really just to show why Bernard is always angry, and how bad a Kluz Yuki is. And her Crazy bad luck! Hope you Enjoyed:D Don\"t worry. There is a plot! lol Keep reading! Thanx:D Don\"t forget to Review! Sana helped Yuki pack her belongings, as they sat together on the enormous king-sized bed in the center of Yuki\"s new room. Large pillowed piled over one another over thick quilts. \"Don\"t worry about today, Yuki.\" Sana assured her. \"Tomarow will be better, you\"ll see.\" \"I sure hope so,\" Yuki sighed. \"Tomarow, I\"ll try twice as hard not to get on Bernard\"s nerves. Like that\"ll be esay, with my luck...,\" As Yuki rummaged through her things, folding her clothes, while Santa put them away for her. She pulled out a small gold-framed portrait. It was a picture of herself. Bernard and Nickolas stood beside her. \"Is this you?\" Sana asked, leaning over her shoulder. \"Yes...,\" Yuki replied distantly. \"Only a week after I was rescued...,\" \"You were so little. What? About five?\" Sana guessed. \"Oh my goodness. Bernard and Santa! They\"re exactly the same height.\" She giggled. \"Santa was only a child then...,\" \"Your right...,\" Yuki said, surprised. \"He seemed so much older when we first met...,\" \"Here,\" Sana took the portrait from Yuki and placed it on the nightstand next to her bed. \"So you can look at it whenever you want.\" \"Thanks...,\" Yuki drifted off before noticing something else sitting on her nightstand. A small, thin hard-covered book. The cover was italic-blue with a drawing, of a small Silvery-haired elf girl, standing alone, looking distantly over a snowy horizon. Sparkling italic Ice sickles dangled from the top corners. The title read: \"The Last Ice Elf\" Strangely, she felt drawn to it. She took the book carefully in hand, flipped it open to the first Page and began to read: \"The Last Ice Elf: \"Once upon a time, there lived a beautiful and Powerful Sorceress. With hair of silver and eyes of Crimson, the Sorceress possessed the power of winter itself. Driven mad with the hatred she felt for the humans, and the entire world. The beautiful Sorceress, threatened to freeze over the entire world, and use it as her own frozen paradise. Mankind was helpless against the sorceress\"s power. In these lost dark ages, it is said that the Elves served as the planets guardians. It was in this time that Cerridwen, the great mother goddess of all magic, granted the Elves their gift of magic, in hopes that they\"d use it in return to stop the Sorceress and protect man-kind. The Sorceress was very powerful, but the Elves fought. Many fell. One Elf rose above the rest. With great Courage, she bravely challenged the Sorceress head on. Piercing a dagger into the Sorceress\"s ice cold Heart. Shattering into thousands of pieces. The Sorceress fell, but in her last breath... She cursed the Elf who had so nobly pierced her heart... \"Thy first born child, for as long as thy blood may thrive, must burden the same fate in death. Let thy heart bear the pain of winter itself.\". With the promise of return on her lips, the Sorceress fell into a deep dreamless sleep, Imprisoned in thick layers of ice, locked away until the day came that her heart could be restored again...\" THE END Yuki read the last few words. She felt herself fall into the story, as if she were there herself. This story felt strangely familiar, although she had no idea why. This was first she\"d read it... \"Yuki? Yuki?\" Sana called, her voice suddenly coming into focus. She was shaking her by the shoulders. \"What? What is it?\" Yuki asked, now strangely more aware of her surroundings. \"What happened just now?\" Sana asked alarmed. \"I was yelling your name over and over again. But you wouldn\"t answer me...almost like...you couldn\"t hear me at all...,\" \"I did that?\" Yuki stared at her friend curiously. \"I...don\"t know. I was just reading this story...and I just...where did this book come from anyway?\" Sana glanced down at the strange book. \"It\"s a children\"s story...,\" It was written by Santa ages ago. \"It\"s an old fairy tale about how the Elves got their magic...its ancient History,\" Sana explained. \"My mother used to read it to me when I was very young...I suppose many here have read it as a child...,\" Yuki glanced down at the cover once more. \"It\"s a very strange story...,\" Yuki said softly. \"I mean, the ending...doesn\"t it seem strange the way it ends like that?\" \"What do mean?\" Sana asked curiously. \"Like...it\"s not finished...like there\"s more to the story or something...?\" \"I don\"t know. If there is more, than I\"m yet to hear it, because as far as I know...that\"s all there is.\" Yuki yawned, placing the book carefully back onto the nightstand, where she found it. \"Anyhow...it\"s a very interesting story.\" Yuki said. \"Did the Elf in the end really get cursed?\" \"That\"s what it says.\" Sana said truthfully. \"Who breaks the curse in the end?\" \"It never says.\" Sana replied. \"Only that the curse carry\"s on to the cursed Elf\"s first born child. That was the curse..., \"Then...what was the curse exactly...?\" \"I can\"t remember...,\" Sana said. \"Hm. Oh well. Makes a good be time story.\" Yuki said, falling back onto her pillow.

Roda looked away quickly - his purple eyes always seemed to see into her mind and know exactly what she was thinking. She heard the rustle of clothes as he sat up beside her, and barely flinched as his arm brushed against hers. \"You\"re not asleep,\" he continued, still looking at her. He had a way of asking questions that didn\"t sound like questions, and Roda found it very odd. \"I was thinking.\" \"Of?\" \"You,\" Roda\"s reply came as a whisper. She drew her knees to her chest as her stomach twisted - in a good way, and flinched again as Noir sucked in a breath. \"Of me?\" \"Yes.\" Roda turned to look at him, and it was Noir\"s turn to jump - as if he thought she was looking into his mind and knew everything he thought. Seconds after, he regained his cool composure, and hummed a noncommittal reply, leaving Roda to wonder if what she did was wrong. Was it wrong? Did other dingoes do this? What was this? Roda was swimming into uncharted waters, touching and knowing things she had not dealt with before. The air and the silence between them grew thin and delicate, and as Roda breathed she feared that she might break that moment with even a small movement of her hands, or even the whisper of a word. Her breath formed white clouds of moisture, twisting and spiralling into thin air. \"Thank you,\" Noir suddenly said, startling Roda, who then looked at him, her ears pink from the cold. \"...For thinking of me,\" Noir continued, and he looked at the ground. \"It\"s okay,\" Roda answered, having nothing else to say. She turned back and felt heat rush to her ears, and let out a warm breath, watching it turn to mist, suspended in the cold blue air. Noir got up without a sound, and said that they should go into town today to find jobs, food, and clothing. He would leave a message for the others to do the same, he said. Roda nodded in silent agreement, and rubbed the sleep and cold from her charred arms. Just as she was about to stand Noir stretched out a hand towards her, the intensity of his eyes shocking her a little. \"Your hand,\" he said softly, his eyes smiling. Roda took it, the pink spreading from her ears to her cheeks, and she noticed his hands - delicate, papery and warm. I started with Roda only because she\"s amazing and she\"s my favourite. uwuNot everything will be shippy I promise I promise I cross my heart and swear that not everything will be shippy- This is about a valiant attempt to get to the kitchen for some bacon. Bree: Thank you! GusSniff.There it was.Sniff, sniff.There it was again - that unmistakable scent of frying bacon. Gus rose from his position on the floor of Connor\"s bedroom, and trotted out into the corridor, his nose keenly trailing the delicious smell of food. Saliva watered in his mouth, and Gus trotted - even faster this time - out into the kitchen, where the sizzle-pop of oil and meat could be heard most clearly. Connor stood at the stove, a frying pan in his hand, and the current cause of Gus\" hunger pangs in it. Almost as soon as Gus entered the kitchen Conner had ignored the bacon entirely, choosing to squat down and pat Gus on the head. \"Gus, I\"m home!\" he cried, and Gus barked. Your bacon is burning. \"Ah, Gus, I knew you were happy to see me too!\" Bark, bark. \"Your bacon is burning, you childish imbecile.' \"A-ah! My bacon!\" Growl, bark. \"Tsk. Other than that, I can\"t believe you\"re eating something other than pizza for once.' \"Gus, are you hungry too?\" Connor lifted the pan off the stove, and put the bacon strips on a china plate, then placed the pan in the sink. The smell of freshly fried bacon filled Gus\" nostrils and he stood on hind legs, supporting his heavy body on Connor\"s belly, his muzzle snapping at the plate as Connor held it out of Gus\" reach. \"Woah, down, boy! Bacon isn\"t good for you! Hold on, let me get you your canned food,\" Connor put his plate on the counter next to his stove, away from Gus\" paws. Gus began to whine, then barked again. \"I\"m hungry, feeeeeed me! Nooow! Don\"t talk about bacon not being good for me - it clearly isn\"t good for you either!' Connor ignored him and reached for a can of dog food, emptied its contents into Gus\" food bowl, and set it in front of the dog. Gus sat on the floor and stared sullenly at the cylindrical block of reddish-brown mush in front of him. A musty smell came from it, and Gus found his appetite slowly imploding into itself. \"Eat up! The can says it tastes like duck, so it should taste good, too! I wonder if it really tastes like duck. Hmm... Oh well. Bon appetit!\" Connor grabbed a fork, and began to stab at his bacon slices before pulling over a wooden stool and eating beside Gus, who emitted a low whine. \"It tastes like rats.' \"I can\"t believe you didn\"t want to come with me, though... I could\"ve been robbed on the way, Gus! Come with me next time!\" \"Don\"t be stupid, it\"s just the market. I know that even you can handle yourself there.' \"Eeeh? What\"s that growl supposed to mean? Gus...\" Gus snorted at Connor\"s overreaction, and began to grudgingly force the dog food down his throat. As Connor continued his whining Gus couldn\"t help but give a small sigh. \"Why can\"t you be sensible for once? I know you\"re capable of it, you immature fool...' But then all of a sudden a horrible itch struck that blasted spot behind Gus\" head that he couldn\"t touch and he began to paw at his ears. Connor noticed it and smiled, then scratched Gus\" ears for him, and Gus began to involuntarily kick his hind leg, leaning into Connor\"s hand in delight. Gus\" stumpy tail began to wag gratefully, and he couldn\"t help but notice how comforting Connor\"s hand was. Endings? What are they? (Urgh sorry I\"ll try better next time round) This takes place a little after Gauche\"s disappearance. YagamiNoir: Here you go! :D BoltBolt\"s muscles ached. So did his bones. He gave a little stretch on the carpet beside the fire, popping his joints and sighing softly in relief. It was cold outside, and the chill seeped into the house through the cracks in the window pane, causing Bolt to sneeze. Alone in Aria\"s apartment, his only entertainment was watching the fire hiss and crackle and trying to keep himself as warm as possible. Sure, his coat was long and he was used to Amberground\"s climate by now, but he was getting old, and heat was a luxury Bolt was determined to have. Bolt wondered about what Aria was doing then. She was one of the few humans he could remember - he had forgotten most of them, after not seeing them for a long while. She had a habit of coming home later and later - probably due to her work. Bolt could almost always smell the tiredness on her, and sometimes he could even smell the acrid stench of alcohol through her clothes. He did his best to comfort her, he did - and when she got back he would often drag her to the bath or to the bed in his persistent way of telling her to get some rest. She would only make an attempt to pet him, most times missing his head entirely, and tell him what a good boy he was. The smile she had on her face then was something Bolt grew to detest, and more often than not he felt like he was the one taking care of her, not the other way around - especially since, if you counted in dog years, he was much older than she. Taking care of Aria was nothing new to him, though. Even when she was a regular Bee he was already looking out for her, for she would often trip over air or slip on wet rocks at least twenty times before reaching their destination. Sometimes Bolt had to carry her violin while she limped along, but he was a hardworking dog and did not complain. The door opened with a sudden click and Bolt was startled out of his thoughts. As he stood his tail began to wag slowly, but his ears flattened and eyes narrowed when he smelled the alcohol on Aria as she stumbled in, red-faced and with a dreamy smile on. Aria waved and stumbled to the sofa, where she threw off her bag and all her clothes and resigned to groggily digging herself a spot in the sofa and lying there in only her undergarments. Bolt growled, nosed the door closed, and made his way over to her, licking her arm in an attempt to pester her into going sleep on her bed instead of on the sofa like that. Aria\"s eyes opened sleepily and she smiled. \"Good boy,\" she said, her voice airy and wavering. A hand reached out to touch his ears but missed, and her arm ended up flopping down the side of the couch. Bolt\"s ears flattened, and he licked her arm again, growling as he did so, but Aria only grumbled at him to go away, and rolled over so her face was buried in cushions, leaving Bolt crestfallen and downright disappointed with his old master. Where has she gone? Bolt asked himself with a whine. His old Aria, she who cared like a mother and hugged like a friend - she, whose soul was kind and brave, and whose eyes were filled with light - where was she? Surely, this splitting image of her, the woman on the sofa in front of him, could not be her. She couldn\"t be. Bolt sniffed and stiffly made his way upstairs, taking hold of a blanket between what remained of his teeth and dragged it down, before he tried his best to cover Aria with it. She sighed, already deep into sleep, and pulled the covers around her, silky, platinum gold threads of hair falling perfectly around her pale shoulders. The stench of alcohol permeated the walls, and the fire warmed them both. Bolt blinked slowly, old, clouded eyes taking in Aria\"s sleepy form with a sense of weariness, before settling down at the foot of the sofa into a listless sleep. Bolt\"s muscles ached. So did his bones. But above all, his heart ached the most. This one\"s really short, because I don\"t remember us having all that many shots of Harry, and I don\"t really have that much of an impression of him w. Sorry for taking so long - I have exams in a few weeks and I can\"t get much (read: anything) done ahhahaha Bree: Thanks! :) Harry Free. That was how Harry felt, whenever he cruised in the skies of Amberground. Below him, the land spread out endlessly - stretch after stretch of barren plain. Whenever Harry flew, he never cut the air - he always allowed the winds to do as they pleased, taking him far and wide - It was as if the wind were the sea, and Harry an expert sailor. Harry often felt as though he were one with the dry air, with the chilly wind, and he often savoured the feel of the cool air along his feathers. It was how Jiggy Pepper must\"ve felt, too, when he drove down Amberground\"s land, his Iron Horse making a nasty purr. In front of him were mountains, their purple-shaded peaks hidden in wispy clouds, and behind him were the cities he left behind - each one with their own distinct charm. He and Jiggy were one and the same, the hawk had decided not long after they started working together. Harry wanted to see the world with his own eyes, and Jiggy wanted to help people with his own hands. The both of them possessed incredible stamina - the human was able to cruise on the land for kilometres at an end, while the hawk was able to fly in the skies for as long as he pleased. However, they still weren\"t as close as many other Bees and dingoes - that probably came as a result of Harry\"s role, which was to pick up letters from people all over Amberground and pass them to Jiggy - but the both of them shared a special connection; a sort of mutual knowing, perhaps. It had to be like that, for Harry always knew where Jiggy was even though they were miles apart, and he was always able to deliver the letters to his partner on time. Harry never hated his job - he took pride in it, as any self-respecting bird of prey would - but he often wondered why Jiggy couldn\"t simply pick the letters up himself. Still, it was a part of his job requirements, and he would do it just so that he could fly. They did spend time together, occasionally, perhaps in the shoddy room of a small motel. They wouldn\"t talk, though, and would only look out the window, each keeping their thoughts to themselves. But they understood each other well enough, both lusting for freedom in their own way. Harry hardly ever thought about what they\"d be like if they were closer - it was fine like this. They didn\"t need to know all that much about each other - they were working partners, and that was it. To them, the other was nothing more than decent company, and an understanding soul. Harry understood, and he never asked for anything more, because the two were as apart yet as alike as the dusty ground and the endless sky - running alongside each other till the end of time, but never to meet. Y\"know that feeling when your friend\"s really similar to some other friend you know, but the both of them aren\"t exactly close...? Yep, that\"s it. WasiolkaWasiolka couldn\"t remember when she had first met the boy. It was one of those things that just happened and that you slowly forgot over the course of better things that came. Whenever Zazie asked her jokingly under which circumstances had they met, she would rack her brain for an answer, or perhaps a certain memory, but she found none. It didn\"t matter to her, either way, because she was too busy being around him then to care about the past. It must\"ve been nice, she thought. When he picked me up. She and Zazie had seared an unbreakable bond, and that was a bond that she was determined to honour. They weren\"t just working partners, not like some other dingoes, they were each other\"s halves. Zazie would feed and play with her, and in return she protected him in the day from gaichuu, and longed to protect him from the monsters that ravaged his mind in sleep - monsters who made him cry out in his sleep and breathe hard and fast. However she could do no such thing, and the only consolation she could provide during those times was her purring - and in answer to that Zazie would hold on to her and whisper things into her fur - words that she could not hear nor understand, for they were not for her. She guessed that maybe only humans could see those monsters and hear those words, and so whenever Zazie had one of those nights she\"d tell him, over and over, If I were human, I\"d chase them away for you. But she was not human, and Zazie could not hear her, just as she could not hear him. However, Zazie was always okay whenever he was properly awake, and he and she could play their game of acting coy and pretending they didn\"t care for each other, although hours later the both of them would be seen fooling around together, with Zazie pulling Wasiolka by the tail or with the other jumping on the boy\"s back. It was then that Wasiolka could purr contentedly, Prussian blue irises thinning in happiness, and the sound of Zazie\"s laughter would ring out loudly, often drawing dirty looks from passers-by. That was okay too, Wasiolka thought, running down one of the cobblestone streets in the marketplace, just as Zazie vaulted over a crate of apples. She followed suit, chasing after the sound of Zazie\"s laughter and the shouts of vendors. It would be nice if we could do this all the time, Wasiolka thought as she leapt over small children, scaring them silly, and as she darted between push carts, following Zazie through the hubbub of the market. Flocks of birds with dappled grey feathers scattered noisily at Wasiolka\"s feet, and she felt as if she could run forever. I keep harping on Zazie having panic attacks that stem from vivid nightmares because this is a Really Big Headcanon of mine ehehehe,,, My exams are over so I\"m finally back! It\"s been too long.Darwin\"s story is really one of the saddest I\"ve ever come upon. I also imagine him as a really stubborn, loyal dog, so I tried to put his stubbornness and grief in here, too (quite obviously). DarwinSleepy eyes peered out at the moving world from under a mop of grubby fur. Flies buzzed around cream ears that were dulled with age. However, the person - no - dog in question paid no mind to such annoying things, his concentrated attention on the people who walked by him. The city was moving too fast for Darwin, he had decided years ago. He was stuck in a time of his own at the foot of the bridge near Olympia Lake - stuck in a time of brown-haired girls and dull, metal-plated charms. It was bothersome to move, and although Darwin had already spent numerous years of his life rotting away at the foot of that bridge he could not bear to leave, because maybe his brown-haired girl might come back to pick him up. She might\"ve grown older, or she might have not. But Darwin could be sure that when he saw her, he could be able to recognize her by her smile and her voice: \"Darwin means \"dear friend\". Isn\"t that right, Darwin?\"But the days grew to be too long for a waiting dog, and so he spent most of his time sleeping and feeding off scraps from kind elders. He\"d had his share of stones thrown by ruffian children and had more than enough of those pesky ticks, but what annoyed him the most was the man with slate-grey hair - the man who came to pester him day after day, hoping foolishly that perhaps he would give up his position at the foot of the bridge. Darwin had never liked him, not even when he was just a boy. He disliked him even more as a man, because he was taller and bigger and at least thirty times more annoying. Besides, who was he to tell Darwin not to wait? Obviously, he didn\"t understand how Elena ever felt. He didn\"t even have a dingo - there was no way he could understand how grief and regret slowly gnawed away at Darwin every time he woke and found his companion missing, or how heart-wrenching it was to watch her walk away and never come back. He didn\"t know how awful it felt to know, beneath everything he forced himself to think, that it was his fault for being incompetent; for being too much of a burden; for not being insistent enough - and it was because of all those reasons that Elena left his side. There was no variation of their circumstances where the bespectacled man would have ever cared for Elena as much as Darwin had, Darwin knew for sure. The man wasn\"t stupid - didn\"t he know that Darwin understood death, and that although he hoped day and night for Elena\"s return he knew, deep down, that she would never, ever- Darwin hadn\"t moved in decades, but he was no slower than he was years ago when he, fuelled by rage, bit the leg of the snide fellow. \"Ow!\" He began to shout, but Darwin kept a death grip on his leg though his worn-out teeth couldn\"t even puncture the man\"s trousers. Don\"t tell me what to do! Furious eyes glared at the man as Darwin let go, leaping back onto the ground where he stood on legs as frail as twigs, quivering slightly. I\"ll wait if I want. I\"ll stay for as long as I want! A low growl which grew into a raspy bark erupted from Darwin\"s throat as he snapped his jaws threateningly, ears pressed against the flat of his head. \"You\"re a stubborn dog,\" the man said, a crooked smile hanging on his face like a broken, splintered signboard. And you are an awful man. Darwin stayed where he was, watching as the man turned his back on him for what was hopefully the final time, his body still trembling and his heart still grieving. im late i know dont hate me Hazle ValentineAfter Reverse was defeated, it occurred to Caribs Garrard that staying with the Amberground government was probably the stupidest thing a man could ever do. He had a feeling they knew about his double-crossing anyway - he could tell by the knowing, dark looks his higher-ups gave him, and he knew that if he stayed, he might just lose his freedom and mobility altogether. He knew what they did to people who didn\"t comply. Therefore, he resigned using an excuse of an illness - more specifically, a growth in his knee joint, and they let him go with airy condolences and empty thanks. Caribs couldn\"t actually believe that they let him off so easy; they didn\"t even take any of the money or incentives that he\"d received over the years. And so, Caribs grew complacent, spending his money as if more would sprout from his garden. Hazle stayed with him as well - Caribs could still afford to pay him, and he wasn\"t willing to lose such valuable protection just yet. However the truth of the matter only revealed itself to him in the midst of a fire. In the middle of the night his bungalow had \"inexplicably\" burst into flames, and Hazle had shaken him awake from the depths of sleep, carrying him together with their coats, and jumping out of the window. Caribs was too dazed to bring his valuables along with him, and Hazle had only three pouches of gold coins that he had managed to bring with him. Later, as his house burned to ashes, Caribs cursed Hazle at the top of his lungs for not bringing more than that, \"surely you could have brought a bag as well!\"He fumed, and Hazle could do nothing but apologize. Upon further investigation of the remains of his house Caribs found a ring of damp earth around the burnt wreck. His eyes narrowed as he rubbed the damp soil between his fingers. Arson. At that moment, fear and paranoia crept into him like thieves in the night, and after pacing about for a few minutes or so, Caribs snatched his coat from Hazle, putting it on with trembling hands (it wasn\"t just because of the cold), and hired a carriage to take them as far away as their money could pay.", "\"Oh, er, hello Matron!\" Irene stood up quickly and smiled. The neat, orderly, white-aproned Matron was standing sternly in front of her, but there was a slight twinkle in her eye. Behind her was May, Melanie\"s sister, who had obviously just returned to school from the hospital. \"What are you doing here? Shouldn\"t you be in class?\" demanded Matron. \"I was sent out for being musical.\" Better just tell the truth and get it over with, thought Irene to herself, a plan formulating in her mind. Matron tried to frown but a smile crept up the corners of her mouth. She was rather fond to the scatter-brained Irene, and knew very well of her absent-minded musical ways. \"Besides,\" continued Irene, noting Matron\"s amused look. \"I wasn\"t exactly doing anything wrong. We were studying fractions, and music has a lot of fraction-like concepts in it. By humming and tapping, I was simply expanding my mathematical knowledge and putting it to use in the everyday world.\" \"I see.\" Matron glanced through the door where the class was working peacefully. \"Well, instead of messing about out here, why don\"t you take May along to her class? They have an extended lesson to make time for a test. Break is in ten minutes and by the time you return you can join your class for that.\" Irene agreed, and set off down the hallway with May, who had jovially watched the whole scene. \"Do you like music?\" asked May as they walked towards the first form classroom. \"Oh yes, I love composing things.\" Irene flipped open to show May the scribbled notes. \"See?\" \"What were you writing?\" \"Oh, nothing much. Just a little victory tune for tying with that smart Leoni. You just came back from hospital, right? How are you feeling?\" \"Oh, much better.\" May certainly looked her normal confident self as she walked briskly along. \"It was nice having Gwen and Melanie visit me. By the way, does the fifth form have anything on this afternoon?\" \"Only a compulsory practice lacrosse game to help Darrell, Sally and Leoni prepare for the match tomorrow,\" said Irene. \"Why?\" \"I guess that means Gwen won\"t be able to come to the town with me, like she promised,\" said May. \"She said she\"d come soon, and you know we first formers can\"t go by ourselves. Perhaps tomorrow.\" Irene looked puzzled, but didn\"t comment. Who could honestly stand the conceited fifth former? How on earth could May put up with Gwen? To be continued... Please review!!!! The Fifth Form Again at Malory Towers! Chapter two \"Come in!\" called Moira. The door swung open and a small girl peered in. She had thick, heavy glasses which slid down her nose and a mess of curly brown hair which was gathered in a sort of ponytail behind her head. She carried an overnight case and lacrosse stick. \"You must be the new girl,\" Moira continued. \"There\"s your bed over there. I\"m the head girl, so you have to listen to me. Go and unpack, and then wash for supper. The bell will go soon.\" The girl nodded and dragged her bag over to her bed, which was close to the door. With great effort she hoisted it onto the bed, and then sat down, panting slightly. \"Are you OK?\" asked Mary-Lou, concerned. The girl nodded. \"I\"m fine,\" she said in a quiet voice which trembled slightly. She opened her case and began unpacking, slowly. Every movement seemed slow and deliberate. Moira seemed impatient. \"Hurry up! Supper will start and end by the time you finish!\" The girl nodded again, and hurried up a little. Darrell felt sorry for her. It must be extremely daunting to enter a room of strange girls, and she thought Moira was being too harsh. She tried to be friendly. \"Hello! I\"m Darrell.\" She introduced all the others. \"What\"s your name?\" \"Melanie. Melanie Brooks,\" mumbled the girl, placing a photo of her parents on her bedside table. \"Welcome to Malory Towers!\" Alicia exclaimed, also trying to be friendly. \"Which school did you come from?\" \"I did-didn\"t go to school be-be-before. I ha-ha-ad a tutor.\" She mouthed each word with effort, speaking with a distinct stutter. At this Gwendoline pricked up her ears. She had had a governess before coming to Malory Towers, and regarded anyone who did as possibly wealthy and important, which she regarded herself as. She hurried over to the bed, imagining Melanie\"s stutter to be sheer nervousness. \"Oh, I also had a governess before I came here!\" She made a great show of helping Melanie by straightening the girl\"s sheets on her bed and fluffing up the pillows. \"It will take a while to settle in, but don\"t worry, I\"ll help you. I know what it\"s like. It can be very daunting, but you\"ll soon get used to the way of life here.\" The other girls turned away, feeling sick, and Irene snorted. Just like Gwendoline to pounce on any new girl who showed signs of being rich. She was always pushing for an important friend, who she could show off her riches and assumed talents to. At that moment, the supper bell rang shrilly through the air. The girls filed out of the dormy to make their way downstairs, Gwen bringing Melanie along. Malory Towers employed two French teachers. Mam\"zelle Dupont was the most popular among the students due to her cheerful nature and sense of humour. She was taking charge of the fifth form table, and beamed at everyone as they took their places. Melanie was last to sit down. She stood uncertainly as everyone chose their places, shaking slightly. Gwendoline called to her. \"Melanie! Come and sit here! There\"s a place right beside me!\" Melanie sat down, smiling a little. She looked in awe at the giant spread before them. Cold potato salad, jugs of hot cocoa, fresh bread and butter, jam and toast was piled in front of her. Gwendoline filled her own plate, and offered to serve Melanie. \"You can eat as much as you want, you don\"t have to worry.\" \"And I suppose that means 30% of all this food will disappear down your stomach Gwen?\" smirked Alicia. \"You\"ll find yourself having to play lots of games and do lots of swimming this term.\" Gwen ignored the comment. It was true she enjoyed her food, and true she was slightly fat, but she hated games and swimming. Just like Alicia to try and bring it up before a new girl. She smiled and tucked into her supper, trying to look as if she didn\"t care at all. Darrell looked around, and spotted the other new girl at the other end of the table. Mam\"zelle was quick to introduce her. \"Now, this is Leoni Green. She is in the North tower as well. I am sure she will make lots of friends!\" Leoni smiled, but soon returned to her supper. She looked very prim and neat, with her thick blonde hair tied in two stiff braids and her pale blue eyes observing everything. \"Where\"s dear old Maureen?\" suddenly asked Irene. \"I haven\"t seen her around.\" \"She\"s in West tower now,\" said someone. Maureen had a personality very similar to Gwendoline, who simply despised her. Everyone did, for that matter. They were only too glad to be rid of her from their dormies and table. \"What?!\" Alicia choked on a piece of lettuce, and Mavis had to thump her hard. \"She moved? Why?\" \"Ah. She is making room in the North Tower for dear little Melanie,\" explained Mam\"zelle, who knew all the details because she shared an office with Miss Potts, head mistress of North Tower. \"Why couldn\"t Melanie just be put in West tower?\" Alicia was annoyed. Betty, her best friend had always wanted to move to North tower to be with Alicia. Alicia would be just as happy to move to West tower. They found it hard to be proper friends in different towers. It didn\"t seem fair that Maureen should get to move to make room for a new girl when they had never been allowed! \"Poor Melanie has been ill, and the North tower is closest to the classrooms.\" Mam\"zelle smiled at Melanie, who took a tiny sip of her cocoa. \"We must all be nice to Melanie, for she has not been well!\" Alicia scowled. It just wasn\"t fair! Darrell tried to change the subject. \"So Leoni, what school did you go to before you came here?\" \"I went to St Dymphna\"s, but I won a scholarship here. I say, is fifth form hard?\" \"Well, it\"s challenging, but not over-the-top,\" Darrell looked puzzled. \"Why? You\"ve been in it a term already.\" \"No.\" Leoni shook her head. \"Last term I was in third form. They moved me up a couple of years. I did the School cert. just last term, ahead of my own form.\" \"They moved you up two years?!\" Darrell stared at her unbelievingly. Mam\"zelle stepped in again. \"Ah yes, Leoni is super-dooper smart! She won a very hard scholarship and is very bright. She will stream ahead, n\"est pas?\" Moira looked doubtful. \"Good luck for fifth form, but I dare say you\"ll find it rather different to the third. We must act much more maturely and work heaps harder.\" Leoni shrugged, and took another piece of bread. She looked confident and not in the least scared. Darrell was amazed. \"Well, two new girls, both as different as they could possibly be,\" she thought to herself. \"I wonder how they\"ll settle in? Well, we\"ll soon find out!\" To be continued... Please review! Dun dun DUN!!! The climax chapter!! Ooh, what will happen next???? BTW: I don\"t know how to play lacrosse, I could only write what I knew from a few basic knowledge and what I read in Malory Towers/Enid Blyton. The Fifth Form Again at Malory Towers! Chapter twenty The day of the lacrosse game dawned bright and sunny. Darrell woke up early feeling on top of the world. She was playing! She had been chosen out of all the fifth formers to represent the senior team! A pleasant feeling of excitement washed over her. Darrell could hardly sit still in class that morning. Sally was the same. Both of them had spent every moment of their free time practicing, and they had thrown so many balls and perfected so many catches, they could hardly keep their minds on the French work in front of them. Mam\"zelle Dupont sat impatiently at her desk. The whole fifth form was excited for their players, but Mam\"zelle had no interest in English sports. She simply didn\"t see the point of tossing a ball around on a grassy field and throwing it into nets. She would much rather sit at a nice coffee shop in Paris and sip hot chocolate while reading a good book. Miss Grayling had kept her word and had a talk with Mam\"zelle. While she managed to persuade the teacher that the fifth form hadn\"t been involved in the tricks, Mam\"zelle had since remained constantly suspicious of all the students, although she could barely manage to stay in her bad mood for long. \"Darrell! Sit up!\" Mam\"zelle tapped her pen on her desk to get the student\"s attention. \"You are day dreaming again!\" \"Sorry Mam\"zelle.\" Darrell looked back down to her book, but the words swam before her eyes and images of lacrosse flooded her mind. Alicia decided to add a comical air to the class, and mimicked an exaggerated lacrosse swing when Mam\"zelle looked away. The whole class tried desperately to control their giggles. Alicia, enjoying the attention, grabbed a ruler and pretended to catch a ball in mid-air with her \"stick\". With a crash and a clutter, she found herself on the floor next to her overturned desk, which she knocked over while reaching out for her imaginary ball. Mam\"zelle looked up sharply. \"Alicia! Do you want to be sent out of class?\" \"No thanks Mam\"zelle. I\"m quite fine here.\" Alicia struggled to right her desk and pick up the mess of scattered papers and stationary which had tumbled onto the floor. As she propped the desk up, the lid flipped open and a volley of textbooks gracefully cascaded out to join the rest of her work. Mam\"zelle frowned. \"Hurry up and behave,\" she snapped, although her eyes twinkled. \"Honestly, the things you get up to.\" \"We\"re just excited,\" Mavis protested. \"There\"s such an important game this afternoon. Darrell and Sally and Leoni may win the trophy for Malory Towers!\" \"Trophy indeed,\" grumbled Mam\"zelle. \"Just a lump of bronze, and all you do is race about madly turning your cheeks red and your hair into a mess. I never understand you English point of sight.\" \"Point of view Mam\"zelle,\" grinned Belinda. \"In France, we would do something dignified.\" \"Like eat pastries?\" suggested Moira. \"All day long?\" \"Yes! The French pastries are like no others.\" Mam\"zelle nodded her head, pleased that someone else at least understood some of the high points of her culture. \"But lacrosse is good for exercise after eating all those pastries,\" said the cheeky Betty. \"After all, too many sweets can make you fat.\" \"Like Gwen,\" hissed a now composed Alicia, quite unkindly. Luckily, Gwen didn\"t hear her from the other side of the classroom. The amusing French class only added to Darrell\"s high spirits, and later that morning Miss James gave her another surprise. The teacher had reconsidered her maths test, knowing perfectly well that Darrell was much more capable than the test had shown. \"But how someone could have tampered with it I don\"t know,\" Miss James said, shaking her head in amazement. \"Anyhow, you can do another test for me later this week, just before reports are finalized. I\"ll put in different questions, of course, but this test\"s mark shall not be counted.\" Darrell thanked her profusely before springing off to break. The day was turning out to be simply wonderful! That afternoon, a large bus rambled up to Malory Towers, and the opposing lacrosse team, who came from a very rich school, tumbled out. They were a big, fearsome looking bunch of girls, who gripped their lacrosse sticks like swords. They joined the Malory Towers team for a light lunch before heading out to the field to warm up. Darrell fiddled with her lacrosse stick, nervous. \"Don\"t worry,\" assured Sally. \"I\"m sure we can beat them.\" \"They look so experienced!\" fretted Darrell, watching one of them shoot a practice ball with a quick, bullet-like throw into the net. \"I can\"t help worrying.\" \"Leoni doesn\"t look worried.\" Both looked to where the calm girl was leaning against a tree, scratching her lacrosse stick in the ground, looking quite bored. \"She hasn\"t talked to us since that monopoly game,\" Darrell said. \"I hope she isn\"t still angry with us.\" \"She hardly talks to us anyway, though I do feel bad. She must have thought we were mocking her instead of trying to help her learn the rules of the game.\" Sally sighed. \"I tried to explain to her, but she wouldn\"t listen.\" A shrill whistle burst through the air, and Darrell, after wishing the others luck, hurried to her spot on the field. The game began, and all at once the other team grabbed the ball, passing it to one another easily. The captain aimed a hard shot, and the ball soared into the net despite the goal keeper\"s best efforts to stop it. The spectators groaned, but cheered Malory Towers on. Leoni didn\"t seem to put any effort in at all. She sauntered about the field, occasionally attempting a half-hearted tackle, but barely watched the ball as it flew from player to player. Darrell looked at Sally in alarm. \"What is she doing?\" \"I don\"t know!\" panted Sally, running off after the ball. \"But I hope she picks up her game. We need Leoni to win!\" The other team scored a second goal, and then another. The Malory Towers girls soon became tired out. They played well, and the goal keeper valiantly saved numerous balls, but Leoni really let everybody down. The whole team had been trained to work together, and Leoni had been given an important role because of her talent, but she ignored all the instructions she had been given and went her own way, walking around, barely moving. The team\"s network of plans crumbled down into nothing. \"She\"s ruining it!\" Darrell puffed, but before she could say more, the ball flew right past her nose. Automatically she swung round and scooped it into her net, racing towards her goal. Two girls ran up to tackle her, and Darrell desperately looked for a team member to throw it to. Everyone was down on the other end of the field, and Leoni was the only one nearby. \"PASS! PASS! PASS!\" yelled the watching crowd. \"PASS!\" \"Leoni!\" Darrell screeched her name and tossed the ball towards her. Leoni looked up, yawned, and grabbed it in her net. She stood there with the ball, eyes half closed. \"RUN!\" yelled Darrell as her attackers spun around and made for Leoni. The onlookers screamed and screamed, all astounded. Leoni was failing the whole team! A stick crashed down on Leoni\"s and the other team had the ball, moving in the other direction towards their goal. Leoni shrugged and fiddled with her watch as Darrell chased after them. Sally aimed a tackle but was a split second too late. The player with the ball shot it towards the goal, catching the keeper unawares. Another goal to them. The half-time whistle blew, and everyone walked wearily off the field, where lemon wedges were being served. Darrell sucked hers furiously, her temper rising. \"What on earth does Leoni think she\"s doing?\" she spluttered, nearly choking on her sour piece. \"She\"s ruining the whole game and she knows it.\" \"Calm down Darrell,\" said the sports captain, tired and irritated herself. \"Don\"t waste energy by getting angry. I want to speak to that Leoni. Where is she?\" But Leoni was nowhere to be seen. She had completely disappeared, and no one could find her. The whistle blew and the sports captain waved for a reserve, but suddenly Leoni burst out of nowhere, shoving the reserve out of the way and taking her place. Everyone glared at her, but she ignored them. Play began again, and what a difference! Leoni\"s dreary attitude suddenly swapped for first-class player. The other team stared in surprise as she tackled, stole the ball and shot a clean goal. For the entire second half, hardly anyone got a chance to hold the ball- Leoni had it all the time. Another goal to Malory Towers, another, and another. Goal after goal was scored, all from different positions to catch the keeper unawares. The crowd oohed and aahed at the game. At one point the whole opposing team formed a huddle and stood in front of Leoni, blocking her way the entire length of the field. Leoni didn\"t waver. She tossed the ball neatly over the heads, and as they all scrambled round to find it, she quickly darted between them, scooped up the ball and continued on her way. There was no stopping her! Victory was secured for Malory Towers, and the whole school shook with cheering. Afterwards, everyone clapped Leoni on the back and praised her, crowding round to talk to her. Despite her terrible playing at the beginning, she had saved the game. Someone asked to write about her in the newspaper, and she literally glowed with delight. \"Well played Leoni!\" said Darrell afterwards, when the hustle had died down, although inwardly she was disappointed that she had not had the chance to play as well as she could have. Leoni smiled a prig little smile. \"Why thank you Darrell, how kind of you.\" \"Girls, watch out, the bus is backing out.\" A sports mistress hurried past towards the games room to put away the balls, and the little group sidled over as the driver carefully navigated the big vehicle down the curving drive. \"Why did you play so effortlessly before?\" asked Sally. \"I was giving you a chance, kind soul as I am,\" said Leoni. \"You\"re always complaining you never have a chance to get the ball when I play, so I thought for a change I\"d let you take command.\" \"But you spoilt everything! You ruined all our plans!\" protested Darrell. \"We could have easily lost!\" \"But you didn\"t!\" snapped Leoni. \"I was there. You should have known you wouldn\"t lose. See how you treat me! You want a chance, and I give you one, and then you completely stuff up. It\"s only because of me that we won!\" \"We only \"stuffed up\" because you spoilt everything,\" said Sally. \"It was a close call. All those training sessions, all those carefully thought out tricks and positions, you ignored them, and on purpose!\" \"You were showing off!\" continued Darrell. \"You knew we\"d be ruined, and decided that a marvelous job at the end would get you all the attention you wanted!\" Leoni smoldered. \"You\"re cruel Darrell. You\"re just jealous.\" \"No I\"m not! I\"m just glad I\"m not a stuck-up prig like you. Always wanting to be center of attention. Always ruining things for us just so you can show off your talent!\" \"You mean, nasty thing!\" Leoni swung around and stalked off. She turned round, walking backwards. \"I\"m in the paper, and you\"re not! I\"m going to get a nice long letter of praise from my parents, and you\"re not, because you\"re so useless!\" Sally suddenly gasped in horror. \"Leoni look out!\" But it was too late. In her huff, Leoni had skipped off, still looking back and calling out taunts towards them, straight into the path of the reversing bus. To be continued... Please review!! DUN DUN DUN!!!!!!! Sorry for the long chapter. Hope you are enjoying the story so far!! Sorry this took so long. This is sort of an in-between chapter, not really a main one. Four or five more after this I think. Thank you for all the reviews. The Fifth Form Again at Malory Towers! Chapter twenty-one Sally screamed. Darrell gagged. The bus swerved violently and ran straight into the perfectly clipped flower beds, the confused driver slumped madly over the wheel. People ran forward as Leoni lay motionless on the ground. Mary-Lou, who had been right nearby, fainted. A few first formers ran shrieking away. The other lacrosse team looked on in astonishment."]}

A caption below is red Jack Basstard. \"No, no, no, no, no, no\" She panicked and began to run down the street. As she turned the corner to see The Company before her, she ran towards the stairs to see Nate looking rather heated. \"What did you do?\" Tiffany cried watching Nate come down the stairs. \"What I told you I was going to do\" Nate said stopping on the last step of the stairs. Tiffany paused before realizing something. She turned with a horrified look on her face. \"You didn\"t delete the picture from your friend\"s phone did you?\" She asked. \"You\"re not the only one with a few tricks up your sleeve,\" Nate said proudly. \"You should be thanking me, he won\"t bother you anymore. You can get a new job and start all over,\" Nate said. \"Are you that much of an idiot\" Tiffany said not knowing what to say. Nate arched his eyebrows. Tiffany heard the door open from behind her the without another thought she uppercut Nate, who stumbled back and fell to the floor. \"...Tiffany\" came Jack\"s voice. Tiffany stared down at Nate with a grave look, as she held his jaw with a stunned look on his face. She turned her jaw clenched to peer at Jack. He motioned for her to follow him with a wave and walked back into the Company. She said nothing to Nate as she followed Jack into the building. They came to his office, Jack took a seat and Tiffany stood before his desk. Jack looked up at her and sighed not happy with the news that just got out. Ten minutes passed, which felt like years of dead silence between her and Jack. Until he spoke with a calm tone, which was only too uncomfortable to Tiffany in such a serious matter. \"Tell me Tiffany, did you know that boy had taken that picture of us?\" Jack asked \"Yes, but I thought I had deleted it, clearly, I was wrong,\" Tiffany said in an apologetic tone. Jack laughed to himself which only made Tiffany think he was crazier than she thought he was. Jack got from his seat and without warning he violently pushed everything off his desk. Tiffany gave a small jump back and bit her lip knowing he was pissed. \"If your father sees that picture-\" Jack muttered to himself as he paced back and forth. \"You should have thought about that before you grabbed me,\" Tiffany said showing no remorse for Jack. Jack stopped in his tracks, looking to Tiffany. \"You think I\"m the only one that\"s going to get in trouble for this? Don\"t be so stupid\" Jack said. He walked up to Tiffany and grabbed both her arms tightly. \"Find-a-way-to-cover-this-mess-up, or I\"ll find a way and it\"ll be only you who pays for it!\" Jack sneered and let go of her roughly. Tiffany gaped at him, feeling the urge to breakdown in tears but she fought them back she took a couple steps back and headed for the doors. She hurried out the doors back outside and down the stairs and back down the street. She pressed a hand to her mouth to suppress the cry that emitted out her mouth. About twenty minutes later she came to Cafe called Aquarius Lounge. It was a small Cafe with light green walls, small baby blue tables, with matching chairs, the floor was white marble. When you entered, to your left you could see a small karaoke stage, to your right there was the rest rooms, and straight ahead was a long bar like table where seats were seated in front of it. There was a boy seated on one of the seats, slumped over the table being served water by the man behind the bar table. Tiffany furrowed her eyebrows and walked over to him. \"I didn\"t know we were opened already,\" she said in a suspicious tone. \"Sorry about that Mrs. McNairenal but I saw this kid outside and I couldn\"t let him wonder around in his state.\" The Tender said. The boy turned in his seat smiling. \"Hi- D-Dan Humphrey\" He slurred sticking out a hand. Tiffany looked back to the tender. \"Is he drunk?\" She asked. \"That\"s why, I didn\"t want to let him go. I called a ride for him on his cell, his dads on his way,\" Tiffany gave a half nod. \"Hey you go to my school\" Dan said. \"You\"re very pretty, I\"m surprised I\"ve never noticed you before,\" Dan said \"Uh-Huh\" Tiffany said and took a seat beside him. \"Dan Humphrey is it?\" Tiffany asked \"That is correct,\" he said and took a gulp of his water which some fell from the corners of his mouth. The tender handed Dan a towel but Dan threw it back at him. \"I don\"t want your pity!\" he shouted. The tender and Tiffany exchanged a look. Tiffany brought her eyes back to Dan. \"You wouldn\"t happen to be Daniel Humphrey, Rufus Humphrey\"s son?\" Tiffany asked. \"That man ruined my future. He takes everything from me, my love life-\" Dan took a moment to think. \"...My love life\" he repeated. \"How tragic\" Tiffany replied. Dan took another gulp of water and to no avail it spilled down his chin down to his shirt. \"O-Kay\" Tiffany said grabbing the towel from the tender and began to wipe his mouth. Dan smiled lazily as she did so. He put his hand to hers having her drop the towel and pressed her fingers to his face. \"You have soft hands\" Dan said closing his eyes smiling to himself. \"Thanks...I think,\" Tiffany said taking her hand back. \"What\"s your name?\" Dan asked opening his eyes. \"Tiffany McNairenal\" Tiffany said. Dan\"s eyes lit up, \"Like McNairenal Records,\" Dan said slurring. Tiffany nodded. \"My father hates your\" Dan said. \"I know,\" Tiffany stated. \"So, I was thinking we could get out of here and back to my place or your place, whatever works,\" Dan said. Tiffany laughed and shook her head. \"Dan, your fathers coming for you, how would he feel if you weren\"t here because you ran off with the daughter of a man your father despises?\" \"So?\" \"Dan!\" A male voice came. Tiffany and Dan looked to see Rufus Humphrey walking over to them. \"Daddy!\" Dan shouted in a cheery voice. Rufus looked to Tiffany who had a forced smile on her face her eyebrows raised, feeling slightly awkward. Though she doesn\"t know whether or not he remembered who she was. \"Thank you for watching him till I got here\" Rufus said. \"No problem,\" Tiffany said. \"Come on Dan, time to go\" Rufus said stretching his sons arm over his shoulder and hoisted him to his feet and began to walk his son out. \"Bye Courtney!\" Dan called out. Tiffany\"s face contorted slight confused by the name he had just called her but knew it was the liquor talking. She chuckled to herself and turned to the bar tender. \"This days just getting better and better\" she said. It was lunch time at The Constance Billard School. Blair and Serena were seated on a table. Blair was flipping pages in a huge red book looking rather annoyed, while Serena looked around the courtyard anxiously for someone. \"I still can\"t find him\" Serena said in a hopeless voice. \"Oh boo hoo\" Blair bluntly stated and continued to look through the pages. \"God, where the hell is that damn testament!\" Blair yelled. \"Why don\"t you get go find some history nerd to help you out?\" Blair asked. Blair took a moment to think about it then slammed the book closed. \"You\"re absolutely right,\" she said. \"Did you get that text message from Gossip Girl this morning?\" Serena asked. \"Yep, don\"t care\" Blair said. \"Who knew Jack was so abu-\" \"I\"m leaving\" Blair said \"Wait, where you going?\" Serena asked. \"I have something to take care of,\" \"Let me guess...Nate?\" Serena asked \"What?\" Blair asked but noticed Serena was looking past her. She turned to see Nate and Chuck heading their way. Nate had a spilt lip and a bruise on his cheek. \"What happened to you?\" Serena asked with deep concern. \"My favorite story in the world\" Chuck said. \"Hah-hah\" Nate mocked and looked back to Serena. \"That post on Gossip Girl this morning, the work by yours truly. I thought I was helping the girl that was in the photo but evidently I was wrong\" Nate said. \"So very wrong,\" Chuck laughed \"Dude, shut up\" Nate ordered. Chuck rolled his eyes and his attention aimed towards Blair. \"Leaving?\" He asked \"Yes, as a matter of fact. Serena I\"ll meet you at the David Lynch Cafe after school\" Blair said and strolled away. The three of them watched her go and looked back to each. \"Hey, I was wondering if you two might\"ve seen Dan anywhere today.\" \"You mean your brother?\" Chuck purposely pointed out. \" Nope, haven\"t seen any sign of him, and what a day it has been\" Chuck finished. \"I haven\"t\" Nate said. Serena sighed deeply and rubbed her forehead. \"Okay, if you see him could you text me?\" Serena asked. \"Sure thing\" Nate said. Serena nodded and put a hand on Nate\"s shoulder for a short moment. \"Hope you feel better\" Nate nodded and Serena walked away. \"Let\"s get to class\" Chuck said looking around. \"Yeah\" Dan\"s house... Dan was lying on his bed burying his face in his pillow, his father pacing back and forth in a heated style. \"How could you be so stupid Daniel? Getting drunk at 8 in the morning, and wandering around the streets. You could have been hit by a car! You could have been killed,\" \"But I wasn\"t\" groaned Dan into his pillow. \"You have those people to thank. Most would have never bothered to let you in their business,\" Dan groaned again. \"You know I would have never expected you to do something like this! You have college to look forward to and a wonderful career that awaits you,\" \"Maybe I should become a rock star like you dad and maybe you wouldn\"t hold such high expectations\" Dan said wearily. \"You think this is funny, Dan?\" Rufus asked sternly. \"Not anymore funnier than the joke of a career you pursued.\" Dan said. Rufus held his tongue and nodded having enough of his son now. \"I want you to find that girl and thank her, apologize for what you did and pay back the drink that they gave you,\" Rufus said. \"Ooh, such awful punishment\" Dan said. \"When you come back, which I expect will be 1 hour after your departure, you\"re grounded for a month,\" Rufus said. \"Yeah, yeah, can you leave now? I\"m tired and you\"re only boring me even more, \"Dan said rudely. \"Oh, you\"re tired?\" Rufus said. Dan nodded and at that Rufus pulled the blanket and then the pillows from Dan\"s bed. \"Oh c\"mon!\" Dan whined sitting up. \"Sweet dreams, Daniel\" Rufus said and walked out with his son\"s blankets. Dan threw himself back on the bed and huffed. Chuck and Nate made their way down the hallway and as they passed the girls restroom, Tiffany came out and grabbed Nate by the back of the collar and dragged him inside. \"Whoa!\" Nate yelled. Chuck turned to see Tiffany. \"Chuck,\" She said as if nothing was wrong. She pulled Nate into the girl\"s bathroom and shoved him into the sinks. \"What are you doing?\" Nate yelled taken by all of it. \"I need you to post on GossipGirl and say that picture was fake, that you altered it,\" She ordered. Nate stood up tugging down at his school jacket and stiffened up his upper lip. \"I don\"t think so,\" Nate said. \"...After that sucker punch I don\"t think I should\" Nate said. Tiffany walked closer to him. \"Nate, please\" she begged. \"...No\" Nate said. \"Nate, listen to me, if my father sees this-\" \"He\"ll kick Jack\"s ass\" Nate said Tiffany shook her head. \"No, he won\"t. The longer this picture is out the greater the danger you\"re in and a greater chance of me getting my ass kicked for letting this picture slip out.\" Tiffany said. \"What?\" \"Just get rid of it, you like me right? You wouldn\"t want me to get hurt right?\" Tiffany asked. Nate nodded. \"Do as I say,\" Tiffany said. She gave a peck on his cheek and walked out the bathroom. Chuck was still standing their, leaning on his shoulder against the bathroom door, his legs crossed. \"Will I being seeing you tonight?\" Chuck asked. \"Count on it,\" Tiffany assured and walked away. It was late in the evening, Tiffany was at the Aquarius Cafe, sitting at the bar table. She was dressed in a pink tank top with a white Worthington Belted Ribbed Cardigan and white capris that went an inch below the knew. Her a.n.a \"Jolie\" Two Tone Ruched Pump were also white. She gazed down at her sidekick, the picture of her and Jack on her phone but with a different caption under it. Poor little rich boy seeking attention by stirring up false accusations against Jack Bass. Tiffany sighed with profound relief. She was so distracted that she didn\"t hear that someone entered the Cafe. \"Hi\" Came the voice. Tiffany turned in her chair to see Dan Humphrey, she smiled. \"You Drunk?\" she asked. \"No, no, I\"m fine, except for the mocking headache I was so graciously given,\" Dan said as he approached her. \"I just came to apologize,\" Dan added. Tiffany got down from her seat. \"It\"s okay, I was happy to help, besides who could deny the son of an awesome rock star like your father,\" Tiffany said. Dan laughed \"You thought my father was an awesome rock star?\" Dan asked astonished \"Of course, I\"ve seen my father take in some new artist but out of all of them you\"re father was the one who really inspired me\" Tiffany said taking her seat again but remained facing Dan. Dan took a seat also. \"How\"d he inspire you?\" Dan asked curiously. \"To sing\" Tiffany replied. \"Really?\" \"Yeah, his lyrics and the way he sang them, they just filled my soul with these overwhelming blissful feelings. His songs got me through some rough times. I figured if he could do that for me why I can\"t do that for someone too.\" \"Wow, never knew my father could have that kind of effect on someone, \"Dan said baffled. Tiffany blushed. \"So tell me Dan Humphrey did Rufus\"s inspirational voice pass down to you?\" Dan laughed going slightly red. \"I\"m afraid it must have skipped a generation\" Dan said. Tiffany laughed and stood up and grabbed his hand pulling him off his chair. \"Come on, lets see if that\"s true,\" she giggled pulling him towards the stage. \"Oh, no, It\"s true really, all true, I sing like a dying cow, plus I have this excruciating headache, I have to be home in less than an hour or the Humphrey\"s will be short a person\" Dan said trying to say something to get her from pulling him to the stage. \"Please, please, please, I want to hear Humphrey Jr. Sing\" she insisted. Dan got behind the microphone looking at Tiffany who had a pouting look on her face. Dan shook his head; Tiffany knew he was falling for it. \"Alright, one song\" Dan gave in. Tiffany clapped cheerfully. Dan smiled. \"Give it up for Dan the Man\" Tiffany said laughing \"No, anything but that name\" Dan said. \"Any suggestions?\" Dan asked. \"How about, \"Dreams\" by your father\" Tiffany asked. \"Perfect, he use to sing us that one to sleep\" Tiffany smiled brightly and walked over to the stereo behind Dan and put on a Karaoke record that had the name Rufus on it, and put it in the stereo. Dan\"s eyes went big as he noticed a TV on the wall in between the Girls and Boys Bath room light up pink. Tiffany walked off the stage and took a seat at a table before Dan. She had a black remote in her hand and hit play. The music started, \"You owe me\" Dan said into the mic. Tiffany laughed \"Sing!\" she shouted. Dan looked at the TV and watched at the seconds count down till he had to sing...5...4...3...2...1 It\"s a wonder how I\"m still awake Day dreaming about the day The day I fall asleep Tired of maybe\"s And tired of the sorry\"s As Dan sang he made a face impressed that her could actually sing. Tiffany\"s jaw dropped, stunned the very same. I want to forget don\"t want to forgive But that seems impossible when I sill Day dream Day Dreaming of those maybe\"s and sorry\"s Just hearing your voice.... TELL ME TO LET GO! Dan yelled the song, sounding just like his father but better. Tell me its okay to go asleep Sleep and forget our dreams... As Dan sang, filling the room with his harmonizing voice, from Tiffany\"s view he seemed so happy, practically singing his life out and he was good, really good. Regrettably for Dan, that didn\"t last long as Rufus has entered the Cafe, Serena and Blair was standing by his side. \"Dan?\" Serena said. Well, wasn\"t that something? Lonely Boy can sing, I guess the saying like father like son came\"s only to naturally in cases like this. But is Daddy Humphrey happy about this discovery? Tiffany arrived at Chucks later that night feeling beat. She wore a diminished look on her face as she approached Chuck, who was coming down the stairs. \"I love the terrified look\" he said. Tiffany saw that he was looking down at his phone and knew off the back what he was looking at. \"It really shows the tenacious side you\"ve so clearly shown,\" \"Look, I don\"t want to talk about it. I already have Nate riding my ass about it,\" Tiffany said. \"Sounds unpleasant, but I could go much gently\" Chuck said trying to sound affectionate. \"Stop,\" Tiffany brusquely finding his words tiresome and predictable. She then took a seat on Chucks stairs which left Chuck slightly pessimistic that\"s she would chose the stairs to sit on. Tiffany sighed and looked at Chuck who was still standing up. \"Sit down\" she demanded. \"Do I have to? People walk up and down the stairs-\" \"Just sit,\" \"Is this some kind of chick thing?\" Chuck asked \"Stop being a cry baby and sit, it\"s not like the dirt from the stairs is going to eat you,\" \"You never know,\" Tiffany rolled her eyes and reached up, grabbed Chuck\"s arm, and pulled him now. Tiffany sighed, Chuck looking at her with a look of shocked disgust. There was a pause before Chuck spoke. \"Was the picture really authentic?\" he asked. Tiffany nodded. \"Does he normally do that?\" Chuck asked \"Lately it seems it\"s all her ever does\" Tiffany answered despairingly. \"But I can\"t let that stop me from finishing what I set out to do. What I do to him, what we do to him will be nothing like what he\"s done to me\" Tiffany said \"You say you\"re looking for something incriminating enough to get Jack out of Bass Industries, that picture could have been it,\" Chuck said. Tiffany nodded. \"Something like that might not have been strong enough to keep him out.\" \"So what more could you possibly find on him?\" Chuck asked. \"Maybe nothing, but if it comes down to that we could always set him up,\" Tiffany said. \"Kind of like what he did to me\" Chuck said. They said no more on the matter and Chuck got to his feet and helped Tiffany up. \"I have a guest staying the night-\" \"Say no more, I\"m going to bed\" Tiffany said and headed up stairs. \"Goodnight\" Chuck called up to her. \"Night\" she said putting a hand up and continued up the stairs. Tiffany was strolling down the hallways of Constance Billard School, her hair straight and pulled to the right lying on her chest. As she made her way down the hallway she saw what looked like Dan from the back. He had his forehead against a locker which she assumed was his. She slowly walked up to him and tapped him on the shoulder. \"If you\"ve come to ridicule me take a number,\" he said glumly. \"Dan?\" she said puzzled. Dan turned on the spot \"Tiffany?\" \"Hey, what\"s going on?\" she asked. Dan scratched the back of his head. \"I forgot you came to this school\" he said laughing nervously. Tiffany blinked her eyes repeatedly. \"Um...\" Dan appeared stubborn to answer but then caved. \"Serena\"s friend Blair put my moment of leisure on GossipGirl. Now everybody knows and doesn\"t pass up the chance to remind me with their crude criticism,\" Dan said in one breath. Tiffany blinked repeatedly taken in what he just said. \"What are they saying?\" She asked with interest in her tone. \"Well, some have been saying how my father sucked and how much I do, others laugh and point, someone even told me not to quit me day job. Even my English teacher said not to chase some fantasy that\"s just going to get in the way of my writing.\" Dan started walking forward and down the hall. Tiffany walked by his side as he continued to tell of the day he\"s been having. \"But what makes me laugh the most is that, I don\"t sing! It was a one time thing, they\"re acting like I\"m trying to become this huge star\" Dan finished with a profound sigh. \"Let them say what they want, if you ask me, you have an amazing voice and I\"ll support you whether you take the writing route or the singing route\" Those words made Dan scoff a laugh \"Thanks, but I\"m going to stick with the writing. It\"s what I\"m supposed to do, it comes naturally and it\"ll keep everyone happy. Especially my dad\" Dan said \"Was he mad?\" Tiffany asked \"That\"s an understatement\" Dan said \"Why? What\"d he say?\" Tiffany asked. \"That\"s just it, he didn\"t say anything. He wouldn\"t even speak to me this morning\" Dan said solemnly. Tiffany frowned feeling remorsefully for the boy. \"Maybe, I could come over today to see some of your writing\" Tiffany said in a proposing tone. \"My Dads usually home when we get their and I don\"t know if you realize this but your not exactly on his friend list,\" said Dan \"We could go now then?\" Tiffany stated. Dan looked at her, giving it some thought. \"True but...\" \"I\"m sure you don\"t want to go through the rest of the day being the High School Musical Foolisicle\" Tiffany said. \"Ah-hah, you\"re funny\" Dan pointed at her. Tiffany laughed. \"Why, I mean what could it hurt\" Dan said they shared a smile and walked out the front doors of the school. \"Where are they going?\" Serena asked coming out from behind a wall. \"Who cares,\" Blair said from behind her. \"Why don\"t you just go and ask?\" Blair said \"I\"m just trying to put some distance between Dan and I so we can manage a friendship relationship after this family connection thing\" \"You mean the incest?\" Blair asked. \"Thank you Chuck 2.0\" Serena barked. Blair gasped. \"Take that back\" \"Find would you prefer me to call you \"Blair Witch\" instead?\" Serena asked folding her arms. \"Anything but Chuck 2.0, it makes me feel dirtier than I already do\" Blair said, Serena shook her head. \"So what are you going to do?\" \"We got to find some dirt on this girl\" \"Why?\" Blair asked \"Don\"t you want Dan to be happy?\" Blair asked", "to get dean out but everything\"s running smoothly I\"ll call you if I need anything just though I should tell you...well bye\" she placed her phone on the sink. Scene: / A limo awaited Peyton and Mrs. Teague out side and Lex Luther stepped out showing Mrs. Teague in \"you look beautiful\" he said to Peyton stopping her at the door \"Bite me\" she retorted Lex gave a small chuckle \"the nights still young why rush\" Peyton gave him a look of loath and stepped in the limo sliding in the seat and noticed Jason who was sitting next to Lionel. Lex got back in and closed the door. They were off...The diner ran smoothly Jason noticing how uncomfortable Peyton was the whole night. Avoiding the topic about Clark when Lex brought it up. Jason had changed it asking his mom how she\"s been doing. The diner came to an end, Lex finding out nothing on Clark drove him to drink and boy did he drink. Not so much that he couldn\"t satnd on his two feet but just enough make Peyton feel real uncomfortable. Lionel and Jason ahd went off to the men\"s\" room while Mrs. Teague went off looking for someone to tell her where the selection of brandy she ahd choosen was imported from. Leaving Peyton outside by the limo with Lex. \"you know you weren\"t really polite when I complimented how you looked to night.\" Peyton rolled her eyes then she felt a hand grab her ass. She jumped \"HEY! Don\"t touch me! She went to smack him but Lex had stopped her hand gripping it hard yelled Jason had walked out the restaurant and had heard Peyton \"what\"s going on?\" he asked They both turned there heads to Jason Lex threw Peyton\"s hand back \"Just having a little fun, maybe you have better luck\" Lex said and got into the limo Peyton rubbed her wrist \"you okay?\" he asked her Peyton nodded sniffling. Lionel and Jason\" mom had come out. They made there way back home Jason sat next to Peyton in the limo. Once they arrived back, and exited the limo, Jason\"s cell phone began to ring. Peyton and mrs Teague made there way into the house And the limo took off, Jason answered the caller id saying it was Lana. Hey Lana...we just got back\" he said \"You coming back here?\" \"Um...I\"d like to but um...my mom...she uh ate something funny at the restaurant and she fell sick I really would like to stay over night watch over her\" \"Oh...okay that fine I\"ll see you tomorrow then?\" \"Yeah how about we meet at the talon tomorrow? \"Alright see you then\" Lana said \"Bye \"Jason said He had just lied to her he wanted something tonight...needed it...Ached for it...he needed her. Jason made his way into the house. Peyton had some from another room, her hair undone. She went to go make her way up stairs before turning to Jason \"You leaving?\" she asked \"I think I\"m staying the night\" he replied Peyton nodded and made her way up the steps, Jason watched her go. He walked into the kitchen waiting for the moment to make his move give her sometime he agreed. \"Jason, honey your still here\" she said with a little surprise \"I\"m staying the night\" \"Any particular reason\" she said though knowing fully well why he was \"I live here too Ma\" he searched the fridge \"You spend your weekends with Lana\" she pointed out \"I\"m tired mother okay...\" he pulled out water \"If you say so\" Jason walked out the kitchen and made his way to him room. He heard the shower on in the bathroom a nervous chill went up his spine. He went to his bed room to change. Peyton came out the bathroom a half hour later and entered her bed room. She turned down the blanket on the bed. Then she turned her head as she heard a knock at the door. Jason stood there dressed in black sweats and a white wife beater. He took notice of Peyton\"s attire. A dark green spaghetti strap shirt that was skin tight, bra less, with very short shorts that were a light pink color. It was tantalizing. \"What\"s up\" she asked Jason shrugged his shoulders and walked in. \"going to sleep?\"He asked \"Think so\" she replied putting her hands on her hips letting out a deep sigh \"Are you getting any more headaches? \"Not today thankfully\" \"it\"s been a good day minus the diner\" She smiled she could sense something was up w/ him, and him just standing there not speaking was killing her. \"I\"m just going to get a robe\" she chuckled nervously but as she went to brush by Jason he stretched an arm around her waist. Peyton closed her eyes Jason pulled her back in front of him. Trailing kisses up neck to her mouth devouring it. He wanted to feel that same feeling he felt that night he shared that kiss with her in the rain. Peyton kissed him back. Oh god was all she could think and soon felt him ready to lay her on the bed\" Jason...\"she breathed into his mouth and pulled back from him \"I\"m sorry we cant, we can\"t do this\" \"I want to, Peyton, I need to, I want you so bad\" he pulled her I to a kiss but she turned her head she had to stay in control she couldn\"t give in she just couldn\"t. \"don\"t\" do this to me Peyton...I know you want this just as much as I do\" he whispered in her ear then nipped it. Peyton closed her eyes biting her lip. The erotic feeling had taken over her mind, disabling her from thinking straight. He began to trail his soft wet kisses down her neck a moan emitting from her throat. Who was she kidding she did want it, she wanted to feel more of him, and she wanted him to touch her all over. She grabbed Jason\"s face he pressed his lips against hers. There tongues\" groping one another\"s, Jason desperately trying to feel the longing touch that was built since the day he met her. Jason pulled away with a bite of her bottom lip. He walked to the door closing and locking it. Peyton kneeled on the bed; Jason walked back over and leaned over her pulling her face to his to kiss her. Peyton slid a hand down his back to the hem of his wife beater tugging at it to pull it off. Jason ardently helped her pull it off. Peyton trailed kisses down his masculine chest. His stomach clenched, Peyton couldn\"t help but smile and nipped at it with her teeth. She brought her face back to his. They kissed tenderly as Jason slowly pulled her shirt off; he captured her mouth devouring it. Peyton was eager to get his pants off, she hadn\"t slept with Dean in a long time and it finally happening again the feeling of lust, need, and passion overwhelmed her body. Peyton felt Jason push his tongue farther down her throat and a moan emitted from her throat. Jason slid a hand down her side hooking his fingers on the lining of her shorts and pulled them down. A moan escaped her lips as his touch sent an erotic sensation to every nerve in her body. Jason discarded the rest of his cloths sliding in the sheets with Peyton. He didn\"t hesitate to enter his cock in her once he got on top of her. Peyton gasped at the friction in between her thighs and Jason moaned feeling relief. She was tight and wet, couldn\"t have asked for more. He hadn\"t had sex in a long time. Being with Lana, the age she was he had to restrain himself until she was ready. But he felt he was feeling something for Peyton he couldn\"t explain exactly what this feeling was but he needed to find out. The kissing was intense more than ever. Jason pulled out and pushed back in side her forcing her back to arch. Jason trailed kissed down her neck to the spot on her collar bone, nipping and sucking and wanted to feel her mouth again, connect with her in any way possible. He kissed back up to her mouth. He thrusted once again Peyton pulled away from his mouth and hooked her chin around the nook of Jason\"s neck gripping his shoulders she nipped at his ear. Waves of pleasure continued. Jason\"s thrusts grew faster and deeper. There moaning and screaming became a constant sound. \"Go harder\" Peyton breathed in to Jason\"s mouth. Jason was only to happy to obliged, and harder he went. Peyton felt his hard cock thrust in with no mercy, she smacked her hand down on the sheets clutching it panting heavily. Sweat frosted there skin, she asked for hard and hard is what she got. Her legs began tremble, Jason seemed to not be getting tired. It felt like he was going to fuck her until she was blue. Her moaning was music to his ears, a sweet sound he hadn\"t heard in a long time. Sometime had passed before he got off her, and laid flat on his back, pulling the sheets up to cover them. The both were breathing heavily he opened his arms inviting her in. she rested her head against his chest, stretching her arm across his stomach. They soon drifted off into silence without any exchanging of words. Peyton awoke to find that she was no longer in Jason\"s arms. Peyton sighed deeply thinking he must have left. She couldn\"t explain what had happened last night, she didn\"t want to. Though she knew she was suppose to stay focused not get caught in the moment. She thought she had control over how she felt about Dean...but he wasn\"t Dean...not exactly. No matter how much his character reflects his true identity there was something about him that made him not so Dean-ish. Peyton pushed her bags out her face. What to do now...let look at it as a one night stand.... affair kind of thing. Affair? Oh crap Lana. Did he even give her any thought when he had decided to bed her? Peyton immediately scrambled to cover herself as Mrs. Teague entered the room scaring the crap out of her. \"M-Mrs. Teague-\" \"Relax child\" Mrs. Teague had a cup of coffee in her hand and handed it to her. She pulled up the vanity chair to the bed and took a seat. Okay creepy Peyton thought to herself She gave Peyton a bank stares before speaking. \"Last night I\"m sure was a one time thing am I right?\" Peyton furrowed her eyebrows wondering what is to her weather or not it was a one time thing. \"it was\" Peyton replied honestly \"As it should be, sweetheart as much as I would like Jason to be with you instead of Lana it just can\"t. What I\"m about to reveal to you is confidential and I need your complete trust\" Peyton nodded wanting to find out. \"There are three stones hidden and one of them belongs to Lana. I set up Jason to meet Lana in Paris, little does he know, thinks it was fate or something. And with you Peyton he\"s second guessing his relation ship with her and I can\"t afford that. I want those stones Peyton and if I see anything that\"s threatening me form getting it I won\"t think twice to shoot if you know what I mean\" Peyton was taken aback was she actually threaten her, I don\"t think so. \" Mrs. Teague I think you know who your talking to, so before you come and threaten me ask your self who is Peyton Sawyer really? You don\"t know me how you perceive me now is nothing to who I really am and what I capable of.\" \"I think your time here has come to an end, pack up and leave and be gone by the afternoon\" Mrs. Teague got up feeling like she just got slapped in the face. \"Fine by me\" Peyton answered with a grim look on her face Scene/ The afternoon came around; Peyton was all packed ready to leave the Teague Mansion. Jason hadn\"t returned which to be honest didn\"t bother her. She knew he must have been with Lana, wonder if he was going to tell her what he did. Peyton scoffed knowing well he wasn\"t going to tell her, but she didn\"t care. Peyton began to think what the hell she was going to do, she had no idea. Then one person came to mind, the only person that can help her. She picked up her phone and called Lex Luther. The phone dial was the worst, waiting for him to answer. Apart of her prayed he wouldn\"t pick up but then a voice came. \"Hello?\" she paused but spoke \"Lex? It\"s Peyton\" \"ah. Mrs. Sawyer you calling about those treatments. I want you to know you can forget-\" \"no I\"m not calling cause of that, it\"s about The Teague\"s, I think we need to bring them down.\" \"Harsh words, whats the catch\" \"no catch a favor\" \"I\"m not seeing the difference mrs. Sawyer\" \"I need a place to Stay\" \"say no more\" Scene/ The doors to Lex study room opened letting in Peyton Sawyer, closely behind was two body guards. \"Thanks guys\" Lex said and the body guards left. Lex put his glass of scotch down on the table and walked up to her. \"I always knew you were smart\" Lex said Peyton ignored the comment and spke what was on her mind \"look, I appreciate you letting me crash here but I would like if you keep small talk...small and keep it strictly business\" Peyton said flat out. Lex smirked \"alright, what do you got\" He asked \"the Teague\"s aren\"t\" sane people, even compared to you guys they\"re less stable, shock right? Anyway-\" Peyton went to speak but Lex interjected \"Don\"t you like Jason Teague, I mean after what I saw the day it was pouring, at the felid\" Lex said \"that was you\" Peyton asked but knew it was \"yep, that was some...kiss\" He said \"it was nothing\" Peyton said \"now why should I believe you, for all I know you could be here working with them\" Lex said \"I\"m not\" Peyton asserted herself \"that doesn\"t give me enough to believe you\" Lex said \"I know that lana is on your list as love interest, breaking Jason of all of it will show us that he\"s just like his mother. Speaki8ng of which she\"s after Lana too and I\"m sure you\"ll do anything to keep her out of harms way?\" Peyton said \"Lets do this then\" Lex said Scene: / That evening Peyton had settled in the Luther Mansion and made her way out to the talon. Peyton walked in to see Jason was at the counter talking with Lana as she bused tables here and there. Peyton saw Chloe at a table hiding behind her laptop, only lifting her head to see Peyton coming over to her and taking a seat across from her. \"Coach Sawyer\" Chloe said \"hey Mrs. Sullivan\" Peyton said \"what can I help you with\" Chloe asked \"We need to talk\" Peyton said \"Alright. About what?\" Chloe asked curiously \"Jason\" Peyton said and then for the next hour she let her know about the real Jason. About him begin Dean Winchester, how the Teague\"s can really be, and to look out for Lana. \"That\"s unbelievable, it\"s incredible\" Chloe spoke. Peyton saw the girl trying to comprehend each fact. \"So can I count on you on watching nout for Lana\" Peyton asked \"of course, no doubt\" Chloe replied \"So where a world zone and Jason real name is Dean and you\"re here to get him out, but how?\" Chloe \"he has to be killed, but I can\"t do it, it has to be someone from this zone and they can\"t know that he doesn\"t belong here. World Zones are complicated, when it\"s done with someone it\"ll kill them off\" Peyton said \"wow once again I am in utter amazement\" Chloe said Peyton gave a smile \"you can\"t tell anyone including Clark\" Peyton urged \"I won\"t, just as long as I know you have this under control? You know with this whole thing, it\"s an intricate plan and doing it alone-\"Peyton cut her off \"I have help. I\"ll be fine. Just do your part and everything should run smoothly\" Peyton said Chloe took a deep breath \"alright\" Chloe said finally Peyton got up from her seat \"take care Mrs. Sullivan and I will see you tomorrow \" Peyton said \"what\"s tomorrow? \" Chole asked and seemed a bit unnerved to Peyton. Peyton gave a laugh knowing she did put quit a bit on her shoulders but It had to be done. \"School\" Peyton answered \"oh right, see you\" Chloe replied giving a nod Peyton gave a wave and walked out, with one last look to Jason caught up in Lana\"s business and she waked out. Scene: the next day Peyton pulled up to the parking lot getting out her car, sporting a pink blouse and light blue jeans, her hair down but was straight. She made her way into the school and entered the Coaches office. Jason was no where to be found. She walked to his desk and began to look through his folders. She had to find something that could get her plan going. Finding something that could get him killed sooner and out o this damn place. The sound of the door came and she put the folder down and turned \"Jason?\" She asked \"hey\" he said softly coming in and closing the door behind her and took a couple of steps toward her \"My mother told me she kicked you out, because you threatened her?\" Jason asked \"She threatened me first but not before letting me in on something about Lana\" She said and walked to her desk \"what are you talking bout\"\" Jason asked \"oh nothing. Though she is playing you like a fiddle. I think that you might believe that you meeting Lana in Paris it wasn\"t she set it up\" Peyton said with a smugly look Jason turned and look as if he was in deep thought. \"She told you this?\" Jason said \"yep caught me waking up after our night together\" Peyton said Jason turned to her \"that\"s it\" he said \"what\"s it?\" she asked \"your jealous\" He said Peyton raised her eyebrows \"don\"t flatter your self\" Peyton answered \"no I think you are, it was a mistake, what we did\" Jason said Peyton had a grave look on he face \"it should have never happened\" he added \"That\"s your fault, you wanted me, you needed me. Are those the exact words you used\" Peyton said Jason didn\"t speak she took a couple of steps to him. \"For you I don\"t think it was a mistake, for me however the biggest mistake of my life\" she said Jason held his tongue. \"Believe what you want, I could give a rat\"s ass. Now if you don\"t mind I have a class to sub and your wasting my time\" Peyton said She pushed pass Jason and left. The bell sounded and class began Scene/ English class, 4 th Period Students were seated in the seat including Clark, Lana, Chloe, and Lois amongst the other students. \"Alright guys I have your essays from last month. Peyton distributed the essays beck to their owners, hearing \"yes!\" and groans following a curse word. Peyton went back to her desk and leaned against it. \"any questions?\" A girl in the back raised her hand. It had been Jamie, who was sort of like a grade grubber. \"Yes?\" Peyton asked \"you gave me a B+\" She said \"That is correct\" Peyton answered \"but I worked really hard on it\" Jamie said \"as did some of the others in this class and they didn\"t do so well\" Peyton said \"Owens got and A on his\" Jamie pointed out \"that\"s cause he made a clear and well essay, whilst yours went off on many points and totally confused me at some points. And the next time you judge someone\"s intelligence just remember who got a higher grade than you\" Peyton said \"It has nothing to do with intelligence. You gave him that grade because he plays on the stupid football team.\" Jamie protested \"no it\"s not the reason, he got that grade cause he developed a clean cut essay and provided a better and stronger thesis\" Peyton defended \"bet that\"s not all he provided for you to get a better and stronger thesis\" Jamie said. Student\"s mouths droped and some gave a scoff of a laugh. \"To - the -office-Mrs.-Key\" Peyton pointed at the door insulted. Jamie grabbed her bag ripped the essay up, letting it all fall to the floor and stormed out. Peyton shook her head pissed. Scene: Practice The players were on the felid stretching, Jason on the bench. He stood up as Peyton made her way over. \"You\"re late you know that\" he said \"no shit Sherlock\" Peyton said grabbing a cup and poured her self a cup of water and belted it down. Jason kept giving her a look which to Peyton made her think he wanted her to say something \"What?!\" she said uptight \"well why?\" He asked \"it\"s none of your concern now is it\" she sneered and walked over to the side line \"alright boys lets get up from the ground and practice play #35.\" Peyton yelled The players got off from the ground and began to position in. Jason knew she was moodier than she should be. Yeah they weren\"t on the best of terms but she wasn\"t mad at him like that. Asking her what\"s wrong was him just asking to get his head bit off. So he kept whatever word he wanted to say to her to himself. AS practice went on he couldn\"t help but notice Peyton reprimanding Owens a lot. \"OWENS WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING THAT MOVE CAN CAUSE A PENALTY!!\" Peyton yelled Jason could see that if he didn\"t do something they were bound to be a player short come next Saturday. \"alright, alright, alright\" Jason said going up to Peyton frantically \"Peyton you need to stop, that play was fine, perfect no, but it will do. Now what the hell is going on, you\"ve been done Owens neck all night, you keep it up and we\"ll be short a player for our next game.\" Jason said Peyton gave a sniffle \"just relax\" Jason said and walked onto the field to Owens. Scene/ Practice ended and the players filed into the locker room. Peyton and Jason went into the coaches office. Peyton sat at her desk, exchanging no words with Jason as he sat at his desk. A knock came at the door when Jason was about to speak. They both looked to it and saw Owens standing there \"Coach Sawyer about tonight I know why you were being hard on me and everything.\" He said \"yeah I can explain that I\"m really sorry\" Peyton apologized \"it\"s alright that Jamie girl is...stupid\" Owens said Peyton gave a look of ashamed knowing that he knew what she had said was embarrassing but she was glad to know he understood. Jason looked to each of them wondering what they were talking about. \"thanks\" Peyton said Owens gave a nod and went back to the room \"and that was bout?\" Jason asked \"a bit of controversy broke out in English class. A student accused me of something\" Peyton said \"and that is\" Jason pushed \"none of your business, it\"s been taking care of\" Peyton said and got up from her seat \"see you tomorrow\" she said and made her way out. Jason rolled his eyes and went to work on the papers in front of him. Peyton started off to the parking lot. Her car parked on the other side. It was dark and it gave a eerie feeling one that was to familiar to her. AS she waked to the car a car had come out of no where and came speeding toward her with getting it was imminent and"]}

I looked away when he swallowed it down \"Also, do you think Imogen would be able to do this for me? Keep track of when I have to take my pills? Having to deal with my panic attacks? Hm?\" he questioned me \"Okay enough with bombarding me with questions. I get your point. I\"m yours and you\"re mine\" I said. He smiled \"That\"s my girl\". Yes, I was Eli\"s girl, not Imogen, but me, Clare Edwards. I\"m not too happy with this chapter. I feel like I sort of rushed it just to get it over with. I kind of got lazy towards the end. Please review! I promise I won\"t be updating every hour, every second of the day. I\"m going to try my best to update almost everyday. It\"s just really easy for me to update fast this week since I am on Spring Break! Thanks for reading! xoxoxo Sorry for the delay in the updates! Senior year is becoming more stressful especially since the end of the school year is coming up soon! I\"ve been so busy with my Senior project trying to finish my essays and what not. Here is the third installment of \"What Gives Me Strength\". Enjoy! Read and Review! As always, I do not own Degrassi. Eli\"s POV As I walking to my locker the next day, I felt someone grab my wrist from behind. I turned around seeing Imogen smiling at me \"Hey Eli!\" she said, I smiled at her \"Oh hey. Didn\"t notice you behind me. How goes it?\" I asked, she shrugged \"It\"s going alright but I have a little problem\" she stated, my eyebrows furrowed wondering what problem she could possibly have, she just got to Degrassi. \"Ah, what\"s up?\" I asked \"Uhm, well, you\"re passing Calc right?\" she said, I nodded \"Mhm. Solid A\" I responded \"Well, see, I\"m having the hardest time with this section we\"re learning. I was wondering if you could maybe, you know, tutor me?\" she sounded kind of shy about it, I looked over at locker seeing Clare waiting for me and giving me a certain look \"No problem. Today at 4? At the Dot?\" I questioned her, she nodded \"Perfect!\" she exclaimed and gave me a quick hug. I walked over to Clare \"What was that about?\" she asked \"She asked me to tutor her in math so I accepted\" I stated \"Elijah Goldsworthy tutoring a student? My oh my, what has this world come to?\" she said jokingly, I rolled my eyes \"Listen, I know you\"re not too fond of her but if you would like, you can come join us at the Dot at 4?\" I said \"I could use some help\" I said again. She chuckled \"I thought you were her tutor\" she said \"Yes but I know that you are way better at Calc than I am\" I said kissing her temple, she nodded \"Alright. Deal. I\"ll catch you later\" she gave me a little squeeze on the shoulder and walked to class.. \"Tutoring Imogen?\" I heard a voice from behind, I turned and saw Adam. \"Yeah, she asked. I thought she was really smart in Calculus. I could have sworn I saw an A+ on our quiz yesterday\" Adam shrugged \"Maybe this is her way of stealing your heart away? You know, typical girl plan. You spend a lot of time with each other and well you realize that you two are perfect for each other.. you know, that type of stuff\" I looked at me surprised \"Well, for your information, I told Clare she could come with us today\" Adam nodded \"Ah, so the girlfriend is there for you to help Imogen keep her hands off of your? Sounds good\" he said. I punched his arm playfully \"Why don\"t you come also? It could be like a... I don\"t know. Study group\" Adam shook his head \"Okay Goldsworthy\" Clare\"s POV \"Yeah so I guess Imogen asked Eli to help her study for Calculus. I swear, I think she\"s up to something!\" I said to Alli. \"Listen Clare, as much as I would agree with you with this whole \"Yep, she\"s a homewrecker\" crap. I have to say, she\"s new to the school, maybe she wants friends? Eli is as weird as her by the looks of it! She\"s probably only talking to him because she thinks they can easily hit it off\" Alli said while drawing hearts all over notebook. \"Okay, I suppose, but still. I\"ve noticed she always looks at him in a creepy way. Like she\"s tempted to take him away from me but she can\"t because I\"m always with him\" I looked down at my pencil that was in my hand \"Maybe I\"m just overreacting\" I finally came to the conclusion. Alli smiled a little \"Don\"t over think it, Clare bear. It\"s probably not even a big deal\" Alli said going back to drawing in her notebook. I looked at the clock that was on the wall \"10 minutes til Dawes and I can finally see Eli\" I whispered softly. As I walked to class, I bumped into someone causing the person to fall flat on their butt. \"Oh I am so sorry!\" I said not realizing the person I hit was Imogen, she looked up at me and smiled \"It\"s totally cool!\" she said and I helped her up. \"Don\"t worry about it\" I heard her say again, I smiled back at her \"So you\"re friends with, Eli?\" she asked, I was confused for a second. Friends? Did she not know I was dating him? I shook the thoughts off my head and responded, \"Yep. Best of friends\" she let out a little smirk \"I really like him. Something about him just makes me go...\" she put her both hands over her heart \"swoon\" she giggled. I gave her a weird look \"Sorry, this might totally be weird for you to have to listen to my little crush on him\" she said placing her hand on my shoulder. I nodded \"It\"s fine but I uh think Eli has his eyes on someone\" I said in response to her little \"swoon\" motion \"Oh\" she said softly. Was this girl really this stupid? Is it not obvious that I\"m Eli\"s girlfriend! I\"ll play along with her though; maybe this was part of plan to get my boyfriend, to play stupid. I mean that is how girls tend to get guys now a day\"s right? \"Well I heard Eli is tutoring you today at the Dot and well he invited me and Adam if that\"s okay with you. He kind of needed help and he asked me if I would be there to help if he had any problems\" I said smiling \"Uh yeah sure, I guess\" her smile soon turned into a frown, I knew she wanted alone time with him, but she\"s not quite getting that today. \"Cool. I\"ll see you at the Dot at 4!\" I smirked knowing that I\"ve pissed her off. I walked into Dawes room and saw Eli smiling at me \"Wow, coming in a minute before the bell rings? Who knew Clare Edwards could be SUCH a rebel\" he said smirking, I smirked back \"Just had some business to deal with\" I said while looking back outside the classroom door. \"Some business, eh?\" he said expecting a much more detailed answer \"Don\"t worry about it\" I turned back around to face him \"Everything is under control\" I finished and turned back around. Again, not really happy with this chapter but I really felt the need to write which is weird. Anyway. Thanks for reading! Please review! :) Hey guys! This is the fourth chapter! I was really bored and I decided to update after I came back from seeing the Avengers haha. Enjoy and review! I do not own Degrassi Eli\"s POV As I walked into the Dot, questions kept running through my head, Clare just didn\"t seem like herself in Dawes today. I saw her talk to Imogen and I know I wasn\"t imagining things. She hates Imogen, so why is she talking to her? The way she had that devilish look on her face when I asked her what was going on and yet she avoided the question. I sat at a booth waiting for the rest of them to come in and join me. I felt someones hand on my shoulder \"Hey, looks like it\"s just you and I for now\" I looked up from my book and smiled \"Imogen, hey. Right on time\" I said chuckling a little \"Do you want to get started? I\"m sure they wouldn\"t mind\" I said once more and pointed to her book. She nodded \"That\"d be great\" she responded. I smiled and opened up the page to derivatives \"Not sure how you don\"t understand this stuff. It\"s quite simple, probably the simplest section out of the entire chapter. The hardest thing you\"ll probably do in this section is memorizing the quotient rule and product rule\" I said, she looked at me weird like I was speaking a foreign language. I coughed a little \"Right, uh so. Let\"s just start off with the simple stuff first, alright?\" she nodded. \"Power rule. Alright. Simple. Easy concept, you\"ll get this one right away\" I pointed to one of the problems \"You always multiply the exponent by the coefficient then subtract one from the exponent. So the exponent in this problem is 2 and the coefficient is 4 so multiply it and subtract 1 from 2\" she still looked at me weird \"Um, 8x?\" she said looking at me weird, I nodded \"Yes. Very good... Look sorry, I\"m not really a tutoring type of person\" I coughed out \"Don\"t worry about it. I\"m a patient girl\" she said laughing a little. I smiled at her. How could Clare hate her? She was such a sweetheart. \"Eli\" I heard and saw Clare walking over to the table with Adam. I scooted over making room for her \"Hey\" I whispered and kissed her lightly on the forehead \"Elijah Goldsworthy, there are people around us\" she said while gently slapping me on the arm. I shrugged. \"Oh, Imogen. I didn\"t see you there\" I saw her smirk. There she goes again with her devilish smirk, does she have a dirty trick up her sleeve? Clare\"s POV Her face was priceless when Eli kissed my forehead \"You two are dating?\" she finally said, I nodded \"See, about earlier. I was trying to hint that towards you but the bell rang\" I said innocently \"I asked if you two were friends, you said yes, you didn\"t tell me you were his girlfriend\" she said glaring a little \"Relax Imogen. I was just answering your question, I didn\"t know you wanted a more detailed answer\" I rolled my eyes a little. \"Okay, can we just study?\" Adam spat out \"We don\"t need a fight just because both of you like Eli. Imogen, Eli is Clare\"s boyfriend, get over it. Clare, Eli is your boyfriend, be happy about it and stop trying to think that Imogen is going to steal him away from you. Clearly, the poor girl didn\"t even know you two were dating\" he said while writing something on his table. I glared at him a little \"Asshole\" I muttered under my breath, Eli looked at me and I could already feel that this study session was getting even more tense as minutes passed by. \"I gotta go\" I finally said grabbing my books and bags \"My mom told me not to stay out tonight. Probably just another dinner with her little new boyfriend, Glen\" I grunted a little and started making my way out of the door. I felt someone grab my arm when I was at my car \"What\"s up with you?\" I heard him say, I turned around \"Nothing. I didn\"t do anything, Eli\" I answered my tone coming out harsher than I wanted it to be. \"No, Clare. You knew she didn\"t know we were together after you guys talked before class. Clare she\"s just a new girl at Degrassi! She\"s lonely. She has no friends, she moved from the States for Christ sakes. How many times have I told you? She\"s getting use to the new environment\" he said loudly \"Why are you trying to make her jealous? Do you think I\"m an unfaithful boyfriend? Do you think I would actually let her come between us?\" he said sighing and squeezing the bridge of his nose. I was about to open my mouth to say something but he stopped me, \"Save it\" he put his hand up \"I don\"t want to hear it. I\"ll just call you tonight\" he said and walked away \"Eli\" I yelled out, he never turned around instead he went back into the Dot and continued tutoring Imogen. Eli\"s POV \"Sorry about that\" I said to Imogen \"I don\"t know what\"s gotten into her lately\" Imogen nodded \"It\"s cool. I understand, I wouldn\"t want my boyfriend to hang out with another girl either\" she said smiling at me. I nodded \"Hey, um, do you want to finish this up at my house? My mom is making dinner and she expects me to be there\" I said laughing, I looked at Adam who smiled at me \"Well thank you for the invite, Goldsworthy. I would love to!\" he said sarcastically \"You\"re invited too, Adam\" I rolled my eyes. \"Well then. Let\"s get going\" Imogen said while packing up her things. I looked at Adam who had a \"You\"re going to get killed by Clare\" look on his face. I nodded \"I\"ve got it under control\" I mouthed, he shrugged and we made our way to my house. \"MOM! DAD!\" I yelled out \"In the kitchen baby boy. Dinner\"s about ready\" I heard her reply back. All three of us made way to the kitchen \"Oh Eli! You didn\"t tell us we were going to have company!\" she said smiling while kissing me on the cheek \"Where\"s Clare bear?\" she asked \"She had to go home. Another family dinner\" I responded \"Ah\" she said smiling and then looking at Imogen and Adam \"Well, Eli, Adam, are you going to introduce me to this new friend?\" she asked raising her eyebrows. \"Oh right\" I looked at Imogen \"Mom, Imogen. Imogen, this is my mom, Cece\" I said \"Oh it\"s very nice to meet you, Mrs. Goldsworthy\" Imogen said while shaking her hand \"Oh please, sweetie, call me Cece. Mrs. Goldsworthy makes me feel a bit old\" Cece chuckled. \"And you can call me Bullfrog\" I heard my dad\"s raspy voice coming from the table. \"Oh it is very pleased to meet you\" Imogen said again, Adam rolled his eyes \"Alright. Introductions over! Can we please eat? I\"m starved\" he said making his way to the table about to snatch a taco shell from the plate \"Adam, no no no. We have to wait for everyone to get to the table\" Cece said slapping his hand away from the shells. Adam grunted \"Fine\". \"Sorry my parents are a little weird at times\" I said to Imogen, she shook her head \"It\"s totally fine. I like it\" she laughed. \"Also, Eli. We have a surprise for you\" I heard Bullfrog say, I looked at both my parents \"Well, am I going to see it or what?\" I asked. Bullfrog and Cece looked at each other and smiled and then started to lead us towards the door \"Ta da!\" they both yelled out when we got to the side of the house where we parked our cars and there I saw a new black Mercedes Benz before my eyes. \"Seriously?\" I looked at them \"You\"re getting so much better baby boy. We thought you deserved to have a car again. Now don\"t crash it. This is a beaut, more expensive than Morty\" Bullfrog said, I rolled my eyes \"Thanks guys. Really. Now I don\"t have to depend on Clare\" I said laughing a little. \"Wow, I\"m definitely going to have to go to school with you now\" I heard Adam say \"Ouch, my best friend using me just because I now have a nice car!\" I mockingly said in a hurtful tone. Adam rolled his eyes \"C\"mon let\"s eat. I know all of us are getting hungry\" Cece said laughing and made her way back inside. \"After you\" I said to Imogen, she smiled and went inside. I sighed thinking about what Clare was doing, I grabbed my iPhone out of my pocket about to text her but I figured I was the last person she would want to speak to. Yea I\"m not too happy about the end but I had no idea how to end it. Thanks for reading and review please! Hey guys! I hope you enjoy this next chapter. As always, I\"m not too sure if I like this chapter or not haha. I hope you guys enjoy your week! ECLARE INTERACTION ON FRIDAY! I am super excited. I can just imagine me squealing throughout the entire episode. I am so sad that season is about to end :( I don\"t know if I could wait til July not like that it\"s along time or anything! Haha. Anyway, please read and review! Thank you! Clare\"s POV Was I being way too dramatic? Maybe Eli was right, I should have straight up told her that we were together. I grabbed my phone that was lying on the stack of books by my laptop about to call Eli, I hesitated at first thinking that he wouldn\"t want to deal with me at the moment. I sighed and called him, pushing my fears to the side. Isn\"t weird that I\"m afraid to talk to my own boyfriend? \"Hello?\" I heard a voice say on the other line \"Eli\" I said softly, my lip starting to quiver \"Clare? What\"s the matter?\" he obviously recognized the disappointment in my tone of voice \"I-I-I-I\"m sorry, okay? Look, I\"m so sick and tired of arguing with you about Imogen and all of that but I\"m just scared, okay? I\"m scared I\"m going to lose you\" I spat out, he sighed on the other line \"There is nothing to worry about, blue eyes. You\"re the only one for me, how many times do I have to remind you? I\"m not going to be an unfaithful boyfriend, I promise. I promise I\"m not going to be another KC to you, okay? Clare, I love you, can you just trust me?\" he asked waiting for a response. It was like the roles were in reverse now. Just a few months ago, Eli was being overprotective of me; he was the one scared of losing me. Now I\"m stuck in that position, is this how he felt when Fitz came back? I sighed. \"I trust you, Eli\" Eli\"s POV \"Good. Now if it isn\"t too late, do you want to get ice cream or something? I just want to get this off our chest. I want to spend some time with my girlfriend\" I said while smirking to myself \"I mean, I guess so\" she answered. \"Cool, I\"ll pick you up in 10 minutes\" \"Wait, Eli, how are you going to pick\" I cut her off \"Don\"t worry about it. Just be ready in 10 minutes, Clare bear\" Before she could say anything else, I hung up the phone and got dressed again. \"Baby boy?\" I heard my mom call from my door, I turned around \"Hey mom\" I smiled \"How do you like Imogen? She\"s new to Degrassi. She just moved from California\" I said to her while throwing on a shirt \"She seems very sweet, a tad on the strange side but it\"s tolerable\" she said laughing. She sat down on my bed \"I was just wondering, how\"ve you been holding up? How is school, Clare, and everything?\" she asked looking at me. I smiled \"It\"s going great, mom. I\"m surprised you have to ask since you did get me a new expensive ride because I\"m quote doing better\" she shook her head \"I can definitely see an improvement, but you know I\"m just wondering how things are at school since your dad and I can\"t constantly be around you 24/7\" I nodded understanding her reason \"Well I am suppose to pick Clare up soon to get some ice cream. We kind of got in an argument today at school and then at the Dot\" I sat down next to her and she put her arm around my shoulder \"Argument? Shocking. You two seem like you guys are doing so well after what happened\" she said. I sighed \"Well, not all couples are going to turn out perfect, mom\" I rolled my eyes at her \"She\"s just getting a tad paranoid. I guess you can say she has the case of the green eyed monster? She\"s getting really jealous of Imogen. I\"ve been trying to reassure that nothing is going to happen and that I\"m not going to let Imogen take me away from Clare but she just seems unconvinced\" I saw my mom nod \"I understand where she\"s coming from sweetie. You see, us girls, we\"re complicated creatures. We go by that line \"Don\"t fuck with what\"s ours\" and I\"m sure boys do that also but I guess you can say that girls take a tad bit more seriously\" I looked at her and I must have had a confused look on my face because she responded with, \"We can\"t handle seeing our boys hanging out with other girls. Let\"s be honest, girls are drama queens, they\"re always trying to find a way to create something to spice up their lives, I guess\" she shrugged. \"I\"m just saying to understand where Clare is coming from also, okay baby boy? Maybe it\"s best to hang out with Imogen only a couple times\" she suggested, I sighed nodding \"I know mom, I know\" I honked the horn when I got to Clare\"s house, hoping she would know that it was me waiting for her outside. The door opened a few minutes later and I saw her jaw drop \"Eli, is this yours!\" she squealed while running to the passenger side \"Yep, my parents bought it for me. It was a surprise, shocking at how much they would actually pay for me especially since they\"ve been paying for therapy and what not\" I said to her, I leaned over and kissed her softly. She smiled \"Well, I must say, I like this new car. I feel a lot more comfortable driving in it rather than Morty, if you know what I mean\" I laughed \"What, Edwards? Couldn\"t handle the hearse? Not luxurious enough for you?\" she stuck her tongue out \"No, it was just scary\" she said, I looked at her weird \"Scary?\" she rolled her eyes \"Just drive so that we can have enough time to eat our ice cream and talk\" \"Your wish is my command, my lady\" I winked \"So how was Imogen after I left?\" she asked while taking a bite of her banana split \"We ended up going to my house after with Adam. My mom made tacos. She seems to be understanding the stuff, I don\"t know why she needs to be tutored\" I mentioned \"Yea, I wonder why also\" Clare said, I looked at her \"Not that I\"m saying she\"s only doing it for a certain reason. I mean maybe she just understands things quickly. So are you still going to be tutoring her?\" she asked me. I shrugged \"I agreed to tutor her twice every week until the test approaches. She was fine with that and she understood that you\"re not very comfortable with her around me\" Clare nodded understandingly \"Well I don\"t want her to you know feel obligated to leave you alone. I mean she can talk to you, I really don\"t mind. I just got that idea of her stealing you away from me in my mind and what not\" she said. I put my hand on top of hers \"See, Edwards. This is what I love about you. It\"s funny how you overreact at one moment and then the next you\"re completely understanding. I like that about you\" I said to her and stole a bite of her ice cream \"Hey!\" she screamed \"I believed I paid for this, Miss. Edwards. I deserve at least something in return, right?\" I teased. She smiled and leaned over the table to kiss me \"I guess you do\" she whispered.", "The Phantom Menace was going to unite two generations of Star Wars fans. Those who saw the movies in the theaters and those that could only guess at what it was like to see it on the big screen. Ultimately, many people saw the story as a disappointment. I was one of those that felt disillusioned by what I saw. As a result, I wrote this novel to address several shortcomings. The introduction of midi-chlorians, a Trade Federation that acted out of character, and a general disconnect to the Star Wars saga seemed to raise more questions than they answered. The novel you are about to read doesn\"t only hope to address that disconnect, but also offer you a new and entertaining story. I will bring you to Alderaan and worlds rarely visited in the Republic with new characters. Together, they will aid our trio in their journey to uncover the truth and prevent the greatest war of their time. Acknowledgements This novel is dedicated to all of the dreamers who are firmly convinced that their dream can never come true. With un-wavering support from Dwayne, Yvonne, Mark, and all of my Facebook friends coupled with the powerful love from my wife Elizabeth, my parents, and the brothers who always pointed out this one goes here and that one goes there... ...dreams evolve into reality.

The satchel that hung loosely from his shoulder bumped into his side in rhythm with his precise pace and stride. Courtesy dictates that he press the door chime before entering. Today was not a day for courtesy. The door opened to reveal a baby-faced enlisted man who couldn\"t have been out of the Republic Institute for Military Excellence more than a few months. He was sitting at a desk tapping his fingers in rhythm to music that was playing from a speaker. \"Whatcha need?\" the young man asked without looking up. \"I need your next of kin\"s location so I can ship them your remains,\" the officer replied. The color drained from the enlisted man\"s face before he shot to his feet. \"I\"m sorry, Major, we had no idea you were coming down to this facility until...\" the Able Crewman blubbered. \"Do you not understand the term \"change of command? Perhaps some field experience in the Outer Rim would suit you better, AC...?\" the major asked. The Able Crewman\"s face went white. \"AC Retera, sir,\" the young man gulped as he allowed the Major to enter. \"Place your thumbprint here to signify that I arrived and began the inspection of my facility before you tell your former commanding officer that his day is about to get very ugly,\" the Major said. AC Retara shakily placed his thumb on the receipt tablet and half-walked, half-staggered out of the reception area. The major didn\"t have to wait very long before he heard a series of shouts from the office the AC walked through. A short time later, a short, balding, overweight man stumbled out of his office. He smoothed his uniform several times before offering his hand to his visitor. \"Captain Antias, commanding officer. What is this all about?\" he asked. \"Are you people really this far behind the times? I thought that General Embry\"s orders carried a little more weight down here,\" the major said without taking the offered hand. \"Dalson Embry gave this order? He didn\"t mention anything like this to me,\" Captain Antias looked thoughtfully at his communicator. \"Fine. You can call General Embry while he\"s giving testimony before the Armed Forces Committee on Coruscant. I\"m sure the nine senators wouldn\"t mind waiting while you discuss orders, already signed by him, that I hold in my hand. I\"ll gladly watch you destroy your career right now or you can get packed,\" the major folded his arms across his chest and waited. \"But Major, I\"m the commanding officer here. I need...\" \"Correction. You were the commanding officer here. As of 0815 local time, I am assuming command of this installation. You are being re-assigned to some desk more befitting on man of your..talents. You have ten minutes to clear your office out before I order Republic Security to help you pack.\" The major looked around the reception area before turning back to the blubbering captain. \"Nine minutes, thirty seconds,\" the new commanding officer said. The captain scurried away and a cacophony of sounds poured out of his office. \"I need your name for the record, sir,\" AC Retera said. \"Relian Issic, Major, Commanding Officer of Republic Scientific and Genetic Research Facility Zero-Zero-One.\" One hour later, three of the finest minds in the Republic were seated opposite Major Issic\"s desk. \"You understand the project?\" Major Issic asked. \"Yes we do. However, what you\"re proposing is...\" a short and furry Drall geneticist said. \"Remarkable? Breathtaking? Groundbreaking?\" Major Issic finished. \"Impossible,\" the Drall corrected. The Major\"s face fell. His sky blue eyes grew very hard as he fixed a piercing gaze upon them all in turn. \"That word does not exist in my facility,\" he said coldly. \"I\"m sorry, but we don\"t have enough...\" a dark skinned human scientist said. \"Enough what? Name your limits and I will exceed them,\" the Major picked up a digital tablet and waited. The three scientists looked at each other for a few moments. Then the furry Drall began to speak. \"We could discuss the limits of cloning for weeks. First, you must understand the very basics of what we\"re working with. Your typical DNA base pair is about a billionth of a meter in length. We need extraordinarily sensitive equipment just to view and extract the strands. Also keep in mind that your typical genome has three billion base pairs. Since most sentient species in the Republic are diploid organisms, that means one genome now has six billion base pairs of DNA. Stretching out the DNA in just one cell would be longer than this table,\" he said. \"How enlightening. How many cells do you require? Dozens? Hundreds?\" Major Issic drummed his fingers on the table. The three scientists chuckled. \"One body, depending on the species, has anywhere between ten and eighteen trillion cells in it. The cells are not the issue. That\"s like asking an engineer how many pieces of durasteel are required to build one star cruiser,\" the Drall said. \"Then what is the issue?\" Major Issic asked. \"We need Oro Thalia,\" he said. \"Who is that?\" the Major asked as he typed the name into the tablet. \"The greatest expert on telomeres in the galaxy. We can\"t do anything without her here. That Kaminoan knows more about telomeres than...\" but he was cut off again. \"Yes, yes, suffice to say she\"s brilliant. What else? Let me be perfectly clear, you need but name what you need to get this project moving and it will be provided,\" Major Issic said. The three scientists all smiled at the thought of what might be. Chapter I - The Skywalker Boys The first of the twin suns crept over the horizon just as it had done each day prior to this one. The barren landscape began to heat, silently preparing itself for the day ahead. The rocks that were scattered along the ground welcomed the solar rays, baking contently in their fixed places, just as they had each morning over the millennia. A single ray from the second sun crawled along the floor of the cramped room and began to slink its way up a bed that was too small for its owner. It climbed up the short bed post until it dragged across the face of a young man who was lying on his side. The sand-blasted face twitched several times, and a hand rose to cover the eye the ray was disturbing. Anakin Skywalker rolled onto his back before yawning loudly. He rubbed the sleep from his eyes before looking at the window that allowed the invading light to attack his peaceful slumber. \"Another glorious day for the Skywalker Boys,\" he mumbled before running a hand through his shaggy head of sandy colored hair. The nickname \"Skywalker Boys\" was horribly inaccurate. Anakin was the only Skywalker that lived in this dilapidated shelter. Owen Lars wasn\"t related to Anakin, but the two were so inseparable that they stopped trying to quash the nickname the public had given them. \"C\"mon Owen, rise and shine. Greet the new day and whatever,\" Anakin yawned again. He looked only a few feet away to see that the other bed was empty. \"Really? You\"re really going to do this again?\" Anakin stood up and stretched before getting out of bed and looking for his lost friend. He stumbled out into the garage as he pulled his shirt over his head. \"How did I know that if you\"re not sleeping or eating, you\"ve got your head shoved into a gasket or a power coupling or whatever else is falling off of her,\" Anakin grinned at the prone figure under the wing of his racing starfighter. \"If you flew with any sense instead of by the seat of your pants, I wouldn\"t have to shove my head into a gasket,\" Owen Lars said without coming out from under the wing. \"You fell asleep under the Volo again, didn\"t you?\" Anakin asked, crouching down and sticking his head under the wing of his racer. \"Wouldn\"t be the first time, won\"t be the last,\" Owen said as he tightened a bolt. \"Owen man, you have got to get yourself a girl,\" Anakin said. Owen emerged from under the wing with oil smudges dotting his pale complexion. He hopped to his feet and stretched his back by twisting it several times before looking down at his friend. Owen Lars had been Anakin\"s best friend since they literally ran into each other on the streets of Anchorhead. Anakin had gotten into a \"minor disagreement\" with six members of the local Republic Military Garrison. While demonstrating how quickly he could run from armed soldiers, Owen\"s body shop provided a perfect hiding place and sheltered him until the soldiers from the \"Flying 14th\" had given up the chase. He hadn\"t so much as provided the hiding place as Anakin had run into the shop Owen was working in. Anakin ducked behind the counter and pleaded with Owen not to turn him in. Owen was feeling generous that day. That generosity paid off. Owen had always had a clear focus of what needed to be done. Working with mechanics was so simple and so straight-forward that everything else in life seemed equally simple. Anakin brought all problems to Owen and his mind worked it out like it was a clogged fuel line and came up with the solution. \"That should improve engine efficiency by another three or four percent. Your thrust ratio should give you a better kick off the start line,\" Owen smiled proudly. \"I bet Beru would give you a better kick off the start line,\" Anakin grinned at him. \"Beru Whitesun? Your groupie, your tag-a-long? I\"m stunned she\"s not here now desperately trying to find some excuse to hang around,\" Owen huffed before heading to the kitchen. \"The definition of groupie is someone who can\"t leave you alone and thinks the suns rise and set because you say so. She says about two words to me and then spends the rest of her time staring at you,\" Anakin said as he followed Owen into the kitchen. In a hovel as small as theirs, the kitchen also doubled as the living room. Anakin liked to think that it also doubled as their dining room, study, library, guest house and solarium. Being on Tatooine meant that every room was a sun room. Anakin picked through the meager remains in their pantry. \"What\"s the deal? I thought you bought some new ration packs? I\"m eight hours from the biggest race of the year and I get to start off the day with this?\" Anakin held up a bag that fit easily in the palm of his hand. \"I meant to bring that up with you,\" Owen said as he sat down on a crate at their small table. \"You are looking at two guys who are one race away from the Promised Land,\" Owen said with a wide grin on his face. \"The what?\" Anakin asked as he also sat on a crate that appeared to be one crack away from shattering. \"I\"ve been saving my half of our winnings from the last few tournaments. Add that in with the earnings from my job as a mechanic out at the Mos Eisley spaceport plus the scrimping and saving we\"ve done. We are very close to changing our lives forever,\" Owen said. \"I\"ve been talking with Damiano Ressik. He\"s willing to sell us his moisture farm. I think that, with a little hard work, we can really make it take off. All it takes is one more win and that farm is ours,\" he continued. The crate groaned loudly in protest as Anakin leaned forward. \"A moisture farm?\" \"The last couple of tournament wins put us in prime position. If you win the Tatooine Classic today, we\"re over the top with a couple thousand to spare,\" Owen was beaming now. Anakin was sure if he had a tail, it would be wagging. \"A farm,\" Anakin said again, his voice trailing off. \"Well? Say something,\" Owen said. Anakin stood up and looked out a small window to the sun-scorched street outside. \"What do you want me to say?\" Anakin asked flatly. \"Do you know anything about farming? I don\"t,\" he said. \"It\"s only the fastest growing profession on Tatooine. Exports are rising at an incredible rate and we can get in almost on the ground floor. If we get the farm and cut back on our expenses for a while, we can expand the vaporators and watch things really take off!\" \"In ten or twenty years,\" Anakin muttered. \"Don\"t you want something more than pulling a few drops of water out of the air?\" \"What else is there?\" Owen asked. \"I don\"t know, something,\" Anakin replied. \"There\"s got to be more to this life than just sitting on a rust colored planet in the middle of nowhere where nothing is destined to happen. How are we going to see the galaxy sitting on our butts watching condensation take place?\" \"Anakin, you keep going on and on about this wonderful galaxy. What\"s so fabulous out there that you can\"t find here? What\"s so incredible about that unknown life you could have on any one of a hundred thousand worlds that would blow away a tangible future on Tatooine?\" Owen asked. \"I don\"t know, Owen, but something!\" Anakin blurted out. \"Something. Yeah, that works. I have a concrete plan here with a real future and you have \"something\",\" Owen said with a smirk. \"I just feel like there\"s more to life than being a water sucker,\" Anakin said as he walked over to his prize racer. \"What\"s really got your blaster in a knot?\" Owen asked as he walked over to join his friend. \"You never asked me about this! You made all these plans, all these goals, and you never asked me what I wanted,\" Anakin said with disgust. \"Well we can\"t stay here forever,\" Owen said looking at the missing piece of their ceiling. \"Anakin, you did something when you took a Cloudhopper for a joyride to impress a gaggle of girls. You did something when you fell through the glass ceiling of the race dealer when you were peeking at the newest whatever it was that the Kuat Drive Yards was selling. Don\"t forget you did something when you broke your bed last week. When you do something to get what you want, it ends in trouble,\" Owen said. \"Maybe what I want isn\"t on Tatooine,\" Anakin said almost in a whisper. \"Owen! Owen!\" Loading a five ton starfighter and maneuvering it into the loading bay at the Tatooine Race Yards was complicated enough. Doing it while nearly another dozen racers are also moving in their multi-ton starfighters required tremendous concentration. Owen found that trying to get the Volo into position while dodging everyone else and having to deal with Beru Whitesun was nearly impossible. \"Beru, now really isn\"t the best time,\" Owen said. \"Oh c\"mon, you always say that. Don\"t you think that XK-12 is really something else? I read up about it and they say it has the tightest turn of any atmospheric craft ever!\" She tried very hard to get his attention. \"The XK series has never been anything more than a flashy paperweight...\" Owen was interrupted by a fast moving magnetic crane flying over his head. \"Beru, I really mean that now is not the best time. Do me a favor and go find Anakin and let him know that we\"re almost ready to start his pre-flight sequence,\" Owen said. \"But I didn\"t get to tell you the best part,\" Beru pouted. \"I think it\"s really cute how you\"ve studied every technical manual you could lay your hands on, but I don\"t need to hear any more about the XK series,\" Owen said. \"No, you don\"t understand,\" Beru insisted. \"He never does, Beru. Unless it has something to do with a gam-shaft or a power coupling, he\"ll never understand,\" Anakin said as he walked up. \"Fabulous timing,\" Owen said as the Volo was unloaded into its prep area. \"Are you done registering?\" \"I just finished giving my thumb scan on the twentieth form,\" Anakin said as he rolled his eyes. \"We\"re ready to fly.\" \"You might fly, but Aiya Rios soars,\" Beru said. \"I\"m sorry, what?\" Owen asked and looked down at her. \"Oh now you want to listen to me?\" Beru asked. \"Now my opinion is important? Well maybe I\"m too important for you and I\"ll take my opinion and go elsewhere,\" Beru said with a flip of her dark hair. Anakin threw Owen a scornful look. \"Okay, I\"m sorry Beru. I would really like to hear whatever tidbit you have,\" Owen said in a monotone voice. Beru brightened up immediately. \"I overheard these two guys talking about some Delta thing that this girl named Aiya Rios is flying. They said she\"s an off-worlder from Corellia and the ship she\"s flying is some sort of prototype or something,\" Beru eagerly said. Owen and Anakin exchanged a glance. \"Owen, that roof I fell through? That ship I was looking at from the KDY? That was the Delta-7 Aethersprite. If she brought it here...\" \"Then we\"re in bigger trouble than I thought,\" Owen finished. Chapter II - Diplomacy \"Young lady, I don\"t think you have the first idea of what you\"re talking about. This bill has already been delayed far too long and your childish reasoning will not stop it from passing at this time.\" Ayers Durane, Chairman for the Committee on Military Affairs for the planet of Alderaan was growing very weary of hearing Planetary Senator Amidala\"s arguments. This was supposed to be a simple bill that would fly through the Committee with the same token resistance given to all the other bills like this one. If she was looking to make a splash as the youngest Planetary Senator to throw a hissy fit, she was well on her way. \"Chairman Durane, I am sure that the Republic has excellent reasons for wanting to expand the size of the Alderaan garrison for a fifth time in the past two years. I\"m sure they are anxious to explain to us exactly why they need all this space when not one company of soldiers has been added in thirty years. But the citizens that I represent and even Galactic Senator Palpatine...\" the Chairman cut her off with a wave of his hand. Ayers Durane picked up a small tablet and examined it for a moment. \"I see that Senator Palpatine has made his wishes clear in the Galactic Senate on Coruscant.\" He put the tablet down and rubbed his eyes wearily. \"This is not Coruscant. This bill is a merely giving the garrison an additional 1.2 million square feet and I see no reason to involve Coruscant in what is clearly an Alderaanian matter. I think we should now move on to other business,\" Durane\"s voice was rising with his temper. \"Senator Palpatine and I have spoken on several occasions and I assure you we will not let this egregious desecration stand. In the meantime, it is true that he is on Coruscant but I,\" she added proudly, \"I am here. I do hereby move that an investigation be launched immediately and an Investigatory Sub-Committee be established to determine the nature of this and all previous expansions.\" Amidala finally sat down and began silently praying for courage. This was her last ditch effort to stall the bill in the Committee. \"Such a motion will not be tolerated!\" Chairman Durane was on his feet now. \"It is outrageous to question the Republic Armed Forces. I refuse to permit such a...\" but a voice coming from the floor stopped him. \"I\"m sorry Chairman, but any motion made by a senator must be addressed,\" Senator Bail Organna said, rising from his chair. He quietly added, \"I do hereby second the motion,\" and he threw a smirk of satisfaction toward Senator Amidala. \"Very well,\" the Chairman growled before slowly sitting down. \"All supporting the motion say \"aye\",\" every senator but Amidala and Durane rose and said \"Aye\". The Chairman desperately looked from face to face for any possibility to dismiss this girl and her ridiculuous motion. \"All opposed say \"nay\".\" A thunderous silence filled the room. \"That was some impressive maneuvering, Planetary Senator,\" Galactic Senator Palpatine\"s holo-image looked pleased. \"The Chairman and I go back to my first term and he is not an easy man to out-fox. You have bought our cause much needed time.\""]}
{"id": "d4853980-bc32-54cf-93eb-cafc4961f206", "fandoms": ["Full House", "Touched by an Angel"], "pair": ["I\"m home!\" Danny called as he walked inside with his new friend, Rosemund Cary. They had known each other for a week now, and were about to start dating. He was about to introduce her to everybody. \"That\"s great, Dad!\" D.J. called from the kitchen. \"Hey Dad!\" He heard Stephanie and Michelle call from their room upstairs. Danny turned to Rosemund. \"Usually they all come out here and try to shower me with hugs.\" He told her, \"Though they aren\"t doing that now. Of course, you obviously know that.\" Rosemund nodded, laughing nervously under her breath. Uncle Jesse came jogging down the stairs in the living room, holding Nicky and Alex. \"Hey Danny, what\"s shakin\"?\" Danny looked at Jesse. \"Jesse, how come the girls haven\"t come in here and hugged me?\" \"Girls,\" Uncle Jesse called, \"Your dads home!\" \"We know.\" The three girls hollered in unison. Uncle Jesse turned to Danny, mimicking the girls, \"We know.\" Uncle Jesse started shouting again. \"Girls, you get your butts in here right now and say hello to your father!\" He sat Nicky and Alex down. \"God, do I sound like my dad.\" Stephanie and Michelle jogged downstairs and hugged Danny. D.J. came out of the kitchen and did likewise. Uncle Jesse gave himself a proud smile and went into the kitchen. Michelle looked at Rosemund. \"Daddy, who is that lady standing in the doorway with you?\" Danny knelt down to Michelle\"s height. \"Well, honey,\" He said, \"She\"s my new friend from the station. She\"s the make-up artist.\" Suddenly the phone rang. D.J. picked it up. Rosemund looked at Danny. \"Beautiful house,\" She commented, mainly to Danny. \"I simply adore your taste in furniture.\" Danny put his hands in his pockets. \"Well, thank you. I always have -\" D.J. looked at Danny. \"Dad,\" She said, \"It\"s for you.\" Danny took the phone from D.J. \"Hello? Oh, yeah, hold on a minute.\" He cupped the mouthpiece. \"Rosemund, it\"s my boss, do you mind?\" Rosemund shook her head. \"Oh, no, darling. Go ahead. I\"ll just get to know your beautiful daughters.\" Danny nodded and went upstairs with his phone call. Stephanie turned to Rosemund. \"So, you\"re a make-up artist. That is so cool.\" Rosemund pulled out a pocket mirror and started fixing her hair. \"Well,\" She replied. \"You could say that.\" \"Rose...\" Michelle began. Rosemund looked sharply at Michelle. \"My name is Rosemund.\" Michelle rolled her eyes. \"Don\"t have a cow. What does a make-up artist do?\" Rosemund put her mirror in her purse. \"Well, sweetie...\" Michelle interrupted. \"My name is Michelle.\" Rosemund ignored her. \"Make-up artist\"s jobs are to make people look glamorous.\" Michelle\"s eye widened. \"So you make Daddy look more glamorous on TV?\" Rosemund shook her head. \"In your father\"s case, we just try to make him look at least suitable.\" The three girls stared at each other with their mouths dropped opened. This Rosemund lady was not very polite! Suddenly Danny came in through the kitchen. \"Well, I\"m done.\" Rosemund looked confused. \"I thought you just went upstairs. How did you get in the kitchen?\" Danny started laughing. \"Oh, that,\" He cradled the phone. \"We sort of have two stairways. But they go to the same hallway.\" Rosemund flipped her shoulder length, blonde hair behind her shoulders. \"Oh, how silly of me.\" Danny looked from Rosemund to his daughters. \"I trust you girls had a very interesting conversation. \"Oh, yes.\" D.J. stated, going back into the kitchen. \"It was very interesting.\" She turned to Rosemund. \"Well, pleased to meet you. Gotta go; bye!\" \"But, Aunt Becky, she was so rude!\" Stephanie exclaimed, sitting on Aunt Becky\"s and Uncle Jesse\"s bed. \"And get this; dad thinks she\"s wonderful.\" Aunt Becky handed Alex and Nicky a cookie each. \"Well, Steph, give her some time. Maybe she\"s not a bad as you think.\" Stephanie fingered the bedspread. \"Yeah, I guess so. Well, I\"d better get downstairs. Thanks, Aunt Becky.\" \"Anytime.\" Aunt Becky replied. \"Alright Kimmy,\" D.J. said, sitting a party bag on Kimmy\"s bed. \"Here are the party supplies.\" It was that evening at 8:00. At Kimmy\"s house, D.J. was organizing Joey\"s party for the next day. \"Three Stooges party plates,\" D.J. said, as she pulled the paper plates out from the bag and sat them on the bed. \"Three Stooges paper cups, Three Stooges napkins, matching plastic silverware, three new joke books, and the receipt from the cake shop.\" Kimmy looked at the assortment of supplies. \"This looks like what my parents give me when I eat.\" D.J. looked at Kimmy. \"Party supplies?\" Kimmy shook her head. \"No; paper and plastic.\" D.J. put the supplies back in the bag and sat it on the floor. \"O.K. Kimmy, can you take good care of it and bring it over tomorrow at 4:00?\" Kimmy nodded. \"Sure, no problem.\" D.J. grinned. \"Great, now let\"s finish planning this party.\" Steve came inside the kitchen, without knocking, the next afternoon; at 3:47 p.m. D.J. was waiting for him. \"Oh great, Steve, I\"m so glad you\"re here!\" D.J. exclaimed, embracing her boyfriend. \"Now, remember your job. Get everyone in the house in the kitchen... and don\"t let them leave until I make the signal.\" Steve looked at D.J. confused. \"But D.J., what exactly is \"the signal\"?\" D.J. thought. \"I\"ve got it,\" She said suddenly to Steve. \"I\"ll, like, make a thumbs-up sign.\" Steve nodded. \"Okay,\" He looked at D.J. \"Now, let the man do his job.\" Steve stood up and went into the living room, winking at D.J. D.J. grabbed the phone, ran up the kitchen stairs and went into her room. She dialed Kimmy\"s phone number, praying that she would answer. Right away, Kimmy picked up. All she said was; \"O.K. Deej. I\"m on it.\" Then she hung up. D.J. looked at the phone and got ready to race down the living room stairs, to get ready for Joey\"s party. \"Hey, Jesse, your hair looks great today.\" Steve told Uncle Jesse, strolling into the living room. Uncle Jesse glanced at Steve. \"Alright, what do you want, kid?\" After a pause he looked back at Steve. \"And whatever it is, you got it.\" Steve was surprised. \"Oh, really? Cool. Uh, J-man, uh...\" Jesse pulled off his reading glasses. \"Yeah?\" Steve rummaged his hands in his pockets. \"Uh, I got these new cassettes from a friend for my birthday and they have some guy singing on them. I think it might be Elvis... but I\"m not sure. So I figured, hey, who better to ask then the king of rock and roll?\" Uncle Jesse stared at Steve hard. \"Steve, Elvis has already died.\" \"Uh, uh, I know that Jess,\" Steve said, \"But, like, now, you\"re the king of rock in roll. So I wanted to ask you.\" Uncle Jesse nodded. \"Yes, yes. Perfectly reasonable, and you know, I think I\"ll help you decipher who\"s singing in that cassette. Come on, bring them on in here.\" Uh-oh. Steve thought. We need Jesse to go inside the kitchen, not stay in here. \"Uh, you can\"t Jess, because I brought my cassette player and it\"s all set up on the kitchen counter.\" Uncle Jesse stood up and stretched. \"Let\"s do it.\" He said, with an Elvis-type voice. \"Go ahead,\" Steve told him. \"I\"ll be right there.\" Surprise, Surprise 2. Surprise! \"Hey Michelle, Stephanie.\" Steve greeted the girls as he walked into their room. Stephanie put down her American GirlTM catalog. \"If you want food,\" She told him, \"it\"s downstairs in the kitchen.\" \"Well, that\"s it.\" Steve said, quickly thinking. \"I thought you girls might want to share some chocolate chip cookies with me. I brought over hundreds of them.\" Michelle\"s mouth dropped open. \"You did?\" Steve nodded with a big grin on his face. \"You bet.\" Stephanie jumped out of bed. \"This is great. Come on, Michelle.\" The girls hurried out of the room. \"I\"ll be there in a minute!\" Steve called after them. Steve tapped on Danny bedroom door. \"Come on in!\" He heard from inside. Steve stuck his head in. \"Uh, Mr. Tanner, could I use your help in the kitchen?\" Steve asked, sounding desperate, which he was. \"Sure.\" Danny said, going in the kitchen. \"I\"ll be there in a minute.\" Steve called after him. Knock, knock! Joey walked over to the door of his bedroom, still holding the recorded laughter tape. He opened the door. Steve was standing in the doorway, looking kind of nervous. \"Hey Steve,\" Joey greeted him. \"Come on in.\" Steve took a step backwards. \"Oh, no, I can\"t. I just was hoping... never mind. Someone with your skills and talent wouldn\"t want to. Nope, never mind.\" \"Go on,\" Joey encouraged. \"You\"re on the right track.\" \"Well, I was hoping that you\"d come down to the kitchen and do a show for us.\" \"Who\"s \"us\"?\" Joey questioned. \"Well...\" Steve said. \"Everybody.\" \"Okay, I\"ll be there in a minute.\" Joey said. \"After all, it is my birthday and everything. Hey, why not?\" Joey sighed. \"Great.\" Steve said. \"Uh, Joey, go down the kitchen stairs.\" \"Sure.\" Joey agreed. Steve sighed with relief. Now he had to hurry into the kitchen. Steve stuck his head in D.J.\"s room. \"All set.\" He announced. \"Great!\" D.J. exclaimed. \"Now go into the kitchen and keep everyone there, under all circumstances, okay?\" Steve nodded. \"No problem.\" D.J. hurried down into the living room and hung a banner over the front doorway that read; \"Happy Birthday Joey! We love you!\" She took a huge amount of presents out of the closet and put them on the coffee table. She went out to Steve\"s car and got out the Three Stooges birthday cake. She hung streamers all over the house. She stuck a tape in the player that had cheering, applauding, and laughing on it. She would turn it on when it was needed. She cleaned up the living room real nice, and got all the dust bunnies out from under the couch (there weren\"t many). She sprayed that goofy smelling air freshener all over the house. You know, usually the smell like artificial flowers and smells weird. But sometimes you can buy the kind that smells crazy and can make your nose do something weird. \"Now,\" D.J. said out loud. \"I can signal Steve.\" Meanwhile, Steve raced down the kitchen stairs. It was crowded full of the Tanner family, not mentioning Uncle Jesse, Joey, with Aunt Becky feeding the twins. \"Steve, where\"s the cookies?\" Stephanie demanded. \"Yeah, you promised.\" Michelle pouted. Uncle Jesse came over to Steve. \"Yeah, it\"s about time to listen to those cassettes. Kid, there aren\"t any cassettes in here.\" Joey held up a puppet. \"Doesn\"t anyone want to see some comedy?\" Danny shook his head. \"No wonder you said you needed my help.\" Before Steve could speak, the back door opened. It was Kimmy Gibbler. She had the party bag in her hand. \"iHola Tanneritos!\" She greeted everyone. Steve gestured for her to go around front. Kimmy nodded. \"Adi\u00f3s Tanneritos.\" She left before anyone could say anything. Then, the doorbell rang. \"I\"ll get it.\" Joey volunteered, going over to the kitchen door. \"No!\" Steve shouted, jumping in front of Joey. \"You can\"t go in there!\" \"I can\"t?\" Joey asked. \"I didn\"t do anything wrong.\" Steve was desperate. \"Look, D.J. will answer, I\"m sure, just don\"t...\" Joey pushed past him, with the rest of the family following. \"...go in there.\" Steve finished weakly. D.J. was hanging up the streamers when Kimmy came in the front door. \"Oh, great.\" D.J. whispered. \"You\"re here!\" Kimmy nodded. \"Well, yeah, do you really think that I\"d forget?\" D.J. rolled her eyes. \"Not particularly. Come on, let\"s finish.\" Just then, the doorbell rang. Kimmy and D.J. looked at each other. \"Who\"s that?\" D.J. asked worriedly. \"I don\"t know,\" Kimmy answered back. \"But whoever it is just rang the doorbell.\" D.J. hurriedly tip toed over to the door and opened it. It was Rosemund Cary, of all people. \"Oh, hello Donna Jo,\" She greeted D.J loudly. Then she noticed the decorations. \"Your father has worse taste then I thought.\" D.J. sighed angrily. \"What do you want?\" Rosemund smiled a sickening sweet smile. \"I want to see your father.\" \"He\"s not here.\" Kimmy broke in. \"He\"s not?\" Rosemund questioned sharply. Kimmy shook her head. \"Nope, he\"s not. He went to NASA, which is located in Hollywood, to test fly the new space shuttle model. It crashed into Snoopy, you know, the coldest planet, right after it took off. So now he lives with the Snoopy-Eskimo people.\" Rosemund looked at D.J. \"And who\"s this?\" She asked. Suddenly, the rest of the household, including Jesse, Becky and the twins, burst through the kitchen door. Rosemund put on a fake, sweet, face. \"Oh, hello, Daniel.\" She greeted him sweetly... or too sweet. She looked at Michelle. \"And how\"s your little Michelle Elizabeth?\" Michelle put her hands on her hips. \"For goodness sake Rosemund, I\"m in the 2nd grade.\" She smiled at Danny, and then secretly gave Michelle a dirty look. Michelle stuck out her tongue. Joey looked at D.J. \"Deej, is this some sort of a surprise party or something?\" D.J. nodded. \"Yeah, I wanted to surprise you, but... well... there\"ll be other birthdays.\" Danny turned to Rosemund. \"Uh, I have to go get cleaned up. Could you stay here and wait?\" \"That will be absolutely divine.\" Rosemund said. \"Great, I\"ll only be a minute. Be back in a flash.\" Danny said, hurrying to his bedroom. \"Yeah,\" Uncle Jesse said, turning to Aunt Becky, \"We\"d better get the kids to Aunt Ida\"s house before she calls us.\" \"Jess,\" Aunt Becky began, \"Why do we have to hurry? It\"ll be fine if she calls us.\" \"No it won\"t, because then we\"ll be forced into having an hour long conversation about haircutting. Now, let\"s get a move on.\" D.J. was startled. \"But Uncle Jesse,\" She asked, \"Aunt Becky, where are you going?\" Aunt Becky turned to her. \"We\"re going out on a date. We\"ve been planning this for months.\" Then she turned to Uncle Jesse. \"Let\"s go.\" And they left. Joey gave D.J. a big hug. \"I\"m so sorry D.J., but we can\"t help other people\"s plans. Danny and Rosemund have a date tonight too; after all, it is Saturday. I mean, everyone has a date on Saturday.\" Michelle looked at Joey. \"Then how come you don\"t have a date tonight?\" She asked innocently. Stephanie looked at Michelle and then hugged Joey. \"Because dad wants him to stay here with us.\" She replied. Joey winked at Stephanie and went upstairs to his bedroom, leaving D.J., Steve, Kimmy, Stephanie and Michelle to deal with Rosemund. Michelle looked puzzled. \"Why doesn\"t Joey have a girlfriend?\" She asked harmlessly. Rosemund applied lipstick to herself. \"Why, isn\"t it obvious? He\"s such an idiot that anyone who would like him would be just ill.\" Everyone stared at each other with their mouths open. Finally, Steve spoke up. \"Well, I guess Mr. Tanner is ill, because he\"s going out with you. But if he knew what you were really like...\" Rosemund just ignored him. \"Well, anyone who likes The Three Stooges obviously is ignorant.\" \"You shouldn\"t be here.\" Michelle spoke up. \"Yeah,\" Stephanie broke in, \"If you don\"t like us, then you should just leave and don\"t come back.\" \"You\"re right.\" Rosemund agreed. \"Why should I hang around people with your kind of tomfoolery and dumbness?\" Everybody just stared at each other, except for Kimmy, that is. \"What\"s tomfoolery?\" She asked. Rosemund looked at the other kids. \"I have proved my point.\" Just then, Danny came back in, straightening his tie. \"Ready to go?\" He asked cheerfully. \"I sure am, good-looking.\" Danny smiled. \"Okay, I\"ll start up Walt- I mean, my nice red car.\" Rosemund turned back to the kids. \"Good-bye children.\" She said to them. \"See,\" Stephanie announced. \"She does think dad is handsome.\" Rosemund gave them a dirty look. \"Actually, he needs a nose job.\" Kimmy nodded. \"I second that.\" D.J. gave Kimmy a disgusted look. \"If dad \"needs a nose job\",\" D.J. started, \"Then why do you go out with him?\" Rosemund smiled a fake smile at D.J. \"Donna Jo, children, I want you to listen to me and I want you to listen to me good. I\"m rich, and your father makes a good deal of money. It would double my income.\" Kimmy nodded then gave a confused look. \"What\"s \"income\"?\" Rosemund looked hard at her. \"Look it up in the dictionary, you ignorant child.\" Rosemund gave them a snotty look and left the house to go join Danny. The kids stared at each other. \"Daddy likes a woman like that?\" Michelle exclaimed, shocked. Stephanie looked at Michelle. \"Michelle, I don\"t think Dad knows.\" Michelle looked at them. \"He\"ll find out.\" \"Joey, could we talk?\" Stephanie asked, going into Joey bedroom, which used to be Jesse\"s room. \"Sure Steph,\" Joey said, putting down a remote control, \"What\"s up?\" \"Uh,\" Stephanie began, \"You know Rosemund...?\" Joey nodded. \"Well, not very well, but yes, I sort of do.\" \"Well, she\"s awful! She pretends to like dad, but she told us that he needed a nose job. And she said that we were trouble and dumb!\" Joey looked hard at Stephanie. \"Steph, is that true?\" Stephanie nodded. Joey stood up and stretched. \"Well, you can tell him when he gets home.\" Stephanie was startled. \"But why can\"t you?\" She asked. \"Because you\"re the one who said she\"s awful.\" \"But,\" Stephanie began. Joey shook his head. \"No buts.\" Danny came inside and shut the door. He pulled up his jacket sleeve and looked at his watch. It read 11:42. He plopped down on the couch. \"Ouch,\" He heard Stephanie exclaim, \"Dad? Is that you?\" Danny quickly stood up. Stephanie was lying on the couch, dressed in her bright yellow PJ\"s. \"Steph, what are you doing up? It\"s almost midnight!\" He looked around. Michelle was lying on a recliner chair, with D.J. sitting on the floor. Stephanie got into a sitting position. \"Uh, dad, before you get happy again... I have to gently break your heart... or whatever Joey says.\" Danny sat back down. \"What is it?\" Stephanie and Michelle looked at D.J. D.J. took a deep breath. \"It\"s Rosemund. She\"s ac-.\" Danny interrupted. \"She wonderful, isn\"t she? You know, she speaks not only English, but she speaks Spanish, French, Italian, German... and some other stuff. She\"s a great singer. And she\"s a wonderful pianist, violinist, flutist, and can play the mandolin.\" Stephanie couldn\"t hold it in anymore. \"But she\"s mean to us kids!\" She exclaimed. Danny looked shocked. \"What?\" \"Well, first of all, she thinks Kimmy\"s ignorant,\" D.J. began. Danny looked at D.J. \"Honey, who doesn\"t?\" He questioned. \"But she\"s not finished!\" Stephanie exclaimed. \"She says we\"re all are dumb; her exact words were tomfoolery and dumbness. Tomfoolery means trouble. She said that the reason she goes out with you is because if you get married to her, her income would be doubled. And she said that you needed a nose job. She\"s really mean, dad. \"Well, yeah,\" Danny continued. \"But,- did she really say I needed a nose job?\" Stephanie nodded. \"Oh my God!\" Danny said. He stood up and looked at Michelle. \"Honey, did she really do all this?\" Michelle nodded. \"Everyone,\" Danny commanded, \"get on the couch.\" The kids piled on the couch, with Michelle on Danny\"s lap. \"Are you three telling the truth?\" He asked. The girls nodded. \"O.K, I\"ll call Rosemund. You girls get upstairs. It\"s way past your bedtime.\" Stephanie kissed Danny. \"Thanks, dad,\" She said softly. Danny patted her shoulder. \"You\"re welcome, sweetheart.\" Danny sighed and went into the kitchen. Danny picked up the phone and dialed Rosemund\"s phone number; I-M-SWEET. Rosemund picked up on the third ring. \"Hello?\" She answered like a Queen or something. \"Rosemund?\" Danny said, \"This is Danny Tanner. Uh, my daughter said some very disturbing things about you. \"Oh, hello sweetie.\" Rosemund ignored the subject. \"Isn\"t it rather late to be calling?\" Danny tried again. \"Rosemund, she said that you said that I needed a nose job.\" Rosemund sounded shocked. \"Now, why would I say that?\" \"Rosemund, she also said that you said my children were dumb and had behavior problems. And the reason we were going out was because if we got married, income would be doubled.\" Rosemund sounded confused. \"But I didn\"t say such a thing. Listen Danny, your daughters don\"t like me. Maybe they don\"t really truly like the idea of you dating. Maybe-\" Danny interrupted. \"Are you implying that my children lie?\" \"Well, what they said is not true...\" Danny was starting to get frustrated. He knew what Stephanie said was true. \"Rosemund,\" he said firmly. \"I\"ll see you tomorrow. Good evening.\" Danny hung up. He realized that he had uncomfortable feelings about Rosemund, but hadn\"t noticed until that moment. He smiled as he went into his bedroom. \" Happy birthday to you, \" The family sang, \" Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to Joey. Happy birthday to you! \" Joey blew out the candles on his cake. Everyone clapped. \"You know,\" Joey said. \"I\"m really honored to be apart of this family... even if we do celebrate birthdays the day after.\" Uncle Jesse leaned over to Joey. \"Just remember, I\"m only here because of the chocolate cake.\" Everyone laughed. Joey started to cut the cake, while Jesse and Becky got Nicky and Alex in their high chairs. D.J., Kimmy, Steve, Danny, Stephanie and Michelle got into their chairs. Joey sighed. \"I\"m glad there are no more surprises for this family right now.\" \"You wanna bet?\" Michelle asked teasingly, pulling out a wrapped present from under her chair. \"What\"s this?\" Joey asked. \"Open it.\" Michelle said excitedly. Inside the wrapping paper was a T-shirt with different fabrics for the sleeves and collar. It was hand sewn and must have been a size XXXXXXXXXXX L. Michelle smiled. \"I\"ve been working on this forever! Do you like it? It\"s for my sewing badge.\" Joey smiled. \"Michelle, I love it. Thanks so much.\" Uncle Jesse smiled. \"Joseph, why don\"t you try it on? Show everyone how it fits?\" Joey glared at Jesse and smiled, \"Okay, okay. I\"ll be right back.\" THE END", "The girl wiped her hand across her face, then finally turned and looked at him. \"Were you ever going to tell me?\" She asked hoarsely. \"Tell you what?\" He asked her. \"Who you are? What you are?\" When he didn\"t respond she sighed. \"You.. you\"re an angel. Right?\" Andrew\"s mouth dropped open, but he quickly shut it. \"Y-yes.\" He stammered. \"Yes, Sarah, I am. But how... how did...?\" \"How did I know?\" She asked weakly. He nodded, still too shocked to say much at all. She sniffed and wiped her face once again. \"I saw you.\" She confessed, picking at a piece of straw that pricked her dress. \"When I came into the store yesterday to pick up Mother\"s things, I saw you through the window talking to my father. You had this wonderful glow all around you.\" She whispered, as if she was afraid to speak of it too loudly. She closed her eyes softly as she remembered. \"It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen before. You looked... you looked beautiful; and so full of peace. I cannot even begin to describe it.\" She opened her eyes again and looked over at him. \"I have not gone mad, have I, Andrew? I really saw this, didn\"t I?\" Andrew smiled weakly. \"No, you\"re not mad, Sarah. What you say is true. I am an angel, and yes, I was speaking to your father. But I never knew that you saw us.\" \"So... you are a real angel?\" She questioned him, as if she was still afraid to believe it. \"Like... from Heaven?\" He nodded. \"Yes. God sent me here for your family.\" She sat there for another moment after that. No words emerged from her mouth and she looked as if she was trying to digest what she had just been told. Finally she looked back at him, her face still depicting a trace of pain. \"You were just going to keep it a secret from me?\" She whispered. \"You were never going to tell me?\" \"I... I don\"t know, Sarah.\" The angel answered truthfully. \"To be honest with you, I never really thought about it. I suppose I should have, you have been very honest with me from the beginning. That is such a rare thing, people are usually so wary of strangers.\" \"Why didn\"t you tell me?\" The girl asked. Andrew thought for a moment. \"Quite frankly, I did not know who to tell. You see, Sarah, I have always been an angel. But we angels have different jobs that God assigns us to. This is the first time I\"ve ever had a job where I spend a lot of time with humans and, well... where I may tell somebody about who I really am. It\"s not always simple and even at this point, it is only your parents that know who I am.\" \"Does Elizabeth even know?\" She wanted to know. He shook his head. \"No. At least, I do not think she does. I did see she and Micah though last evening.\" \"You did?\" \"Mm-hum, and she is still very upset about what happened to Samuel. Which is reasonable, of course.\" He added. \"And I think you should know that despite everything that has happened within the last few days, Micah and your sister are still going to remain on good terms.\" \"But I thought Micah would have been so angry... and so hurt.\" Sarah spoke the thoughts in her mind. \"Is he and Elizabeth going to get married?\" Andrew shrugged. \"I don\"t know that answer to that question, I\"m afraid.\" \"But... but you\"re an angel. Don\"t you know?\" She looked intently at him. He smiled softly. \"Angels do not know everything, Sarah, we cannot predict the future. I cannot even tell you what you will have for supper tonight. But I can tell you that through these latest events, Micah and your father have both learned a lot. And even if Micah never marries your sister, he will always stand by her and do whatever he can for her as a true friend should.\" She nodded. \"I\"m glad for that. I do like Micah, Andrew. I would hate to think that we would never see him around here anymore.\" \"I have a feeling you will still continue to see quite a bit of him, so I would not worry about that. These last few days have taught that young man a lot.\" Andrew smiled at his young friend. \"But you know, your father has learned a lot too, and just like Micah, he is already beginning to apply it to his life.\" Sarah reached up her hand and scratched briefly behind her ear. \"What do you mean?\" \"Your father is trying to change his attitude; you know, that prejudice he has had against Loyalists for as long as you can remember?\" When she nodded, he continued. \"When Samuel died the other day, he died not only by trying to protect one man\"s, your father, store. But he also died saving another man\"s life. Both of those men being downright Patriots who obviously despised Samuel; simply because they did not agree with him. \"It took him a little while,\" Andrew continued. \"But it eventually made an impression on your father. You know that young man that your father saved and brought home last evening?\" \"Yes.\" She confirmed. \"Isn\"t his name... Thomas?\" Andrew nodded. \"That\"s it. Did you know that Thomas is a Loyalist? One of the ones in the store the other day?\" Sarah\"s eyes widened. \"Is he really?\" Andrew nodded. \"Yes. Your father wants to do the right thing, Sarah. It\"s not going to be easy for him, as he has had this prejudice in his heart for so long. But in time, and with God\"s help, he\"ll learn to change his heart.\" The girl smiled at this. \"I\"m so glad to hear that. I\"ve always hated the conflict between the people of these colonies and I\"ve hated what it did to my father. You know...\" She glanced down and paused for a moment. Then she looked back up at him shyly. \"I\"ve been praying that God would help our family. I had been asking for the longest time.\" She admitted. \"And then just when I was beginning to think He wasn\"t listening... He sent you to us, Andrew.\" The angel smiled fondly at her. \"That\"s right, He did. But, Sarah, God always hears you. Sometimes it may not seem like it, but He does. He\"s always listening and He\"ll always be right there beside you, no matter what. He may not always send an angel, but He\"ll never let you down. He loves you too much to do that.\" He laid his hand on her shoulder and looked her in the eye. \"Remember that for me, alright?\" She nodded. \"I will, Andrew. I\"ll never forget it, I promise. I, I\"m sorry for telling you to go away.\" She then added softly. He shook his head. \"Don\"t be. I\"m the one who should be sorry. I should have said something to you. After all, you have been so honest with me from the very beginning. Will you forgive me?\" He asked her sincerely. \"Believe me, I never wanted to hurt you.\" She nodded. \"I know you didn\"t and I do forgive you, Andrew.\" She told him. Hearing this, he smiled and looked at her. \"Sarah, I came in here because I wanted to tell you how much you mean to me. You have become such a special friend and I\"m so glad that I have gotten the chance to know you.\" \"You are?\" She whispered, somewhat in awe. He nodded.\"I am. And you may not realize it, but you helped me through a lot while I\"ve been here and made a lasting impact on me.\" He reached his hand out and lifted her chin up, so he could see her face better. \"I will never forget you, Sarah Chandler. That I can promise you.\" The girl\"s eyes then filled with tears. \"I won\"t ever forget you either, Andrew. Not ever.\" She sighed and then glanced down sadly. \"So, I guess this means you will be leaving soon, doesn\"t it?\" The angel nodded slowly. \"Yes, I will be going to Samuel\"s funeral, but I will be leaving after that. Tess too.\" He added softly. She looked up at him suddenly. \"Tess? She is an angel, as well?\" Andrew nodded. \"That doesn\"t really surprise me so much, I guess.\" The girl admitted honestly. \"I always thought there was something different... something special about her... I\"ll miss you both once you are gone.\" \"I\"ll miss you too.\" The angel replied quietly. As the words ended, he held out his arms and Sarah leaned over and embraced him, resting her head on his shoulder. And together they sat, in silent friendship, until they were called to leave for the funeral. Welcome to the next chapter, everyone. I don\"t really think I have a whole lot to say this time around, except thanks for the reviews. The feedback I\"ve been getting from your reviews has been incredible. You\"re awesome. ;-) Also, there will be two more chapters after this one. Then this particular tale will be completed. Enjoy! Chapter Thirty-Four Half an hour later, a small group of people stood clustered together at a small church cemetery. Despite the occasion, the day continued to look cheerful. As the minister read from his Bible, his voice filled the still air strongly and surely. Those that made up the crowd of mourners stood quietly, though tears were evident in many of their eyes. Mary Chandler stood quietly beside her husband, who wore a solemn look of respect on his face. Their youngest children, including Sarah, stood in front of them and listened quietly to the words that were being read. Elizabeth stood off to the side a bit from her family and Micah was beside her, his arm wrapped protectively over her shoulder. There were tears in her eyes as she stood there and she was undoubtedly recalling her last moments with Samuel. There were other people at the service as well; family and other friends of the young man. Even Thomas Goodson stood there. He had started to feel well enough, so the Chandlers had asked him to come along and he had quietly agreed. No one else there knew what his connection was to Samuel and those that did know had decided not to share. The young loyalist wore a reflective and contemplative expression on his face, as he too replayed the events of only a few days before. And finally, off towards the back of the crowd stood Andrew. He stood quietly and alone at this point. He was trying to concentrate on what the minister was saying, but again and again he would find his mind drifting to other things. He thought about the previous few days. So much had happened in only a short amount of time. He had been promoted and been given his first assignment as a caseworker and during that time he had learned so much. He also thought about Samuel and what a special heart he had. The angel found many admirable qualities in the young man and at that point decided that many, many people could learn something from him. Then noticing the silence that had suddenly engulfed the air, Andrew looked up expectantly. The minister had finished speaking and now John was making his way to the front of the crowd. When he got there, he said something softly to the minister. The minister nodded, then the John cleared his throat and turned to face the group. \"I believe that most of you know who I am.\" The shopkeeper began. \"My name is John Chandler, I run a store in town.\" When he got some nods of recognition, he continued. \"I never really knew Samuel.\" He said. \"I know that my daughter had gotten to know him well, but I never did. As a matter of fact, I think I have probably learned more about him in his death than during his life. But I have also learned things from him. In his death, Samuel taught me a great deal and if you will all allow me, I believe that of he were here now, he would like me to share it with you. \"Samuel was a strong believer in the king, he was a Loyalist.\" The shopkeeper continued. \"I am sure that many of you know that already. But while he supported the British Empire, he did not let his ideas control his life. He could make friends with someone, even if they did not share his beliefs and he would also help someone in the same way. He showed that to me two days ago. I am a Patriot, and I have to admit, I treated this young man less than kind and he did not deserve the attitude and treatment I gave him. But when the time came that my store, my daughter, and even myself were being threatened by those that share the same beliefs that he did, he took action and defended us. He stood up for what he believed in, yet at crucial points he chose to stand up for something that he believed in even more... and that is love.\" At this, John took a deep breath, then looked back out surely at the crowd. \"Samuel died for what he believed in and I will not let his death be in vain. I hope that none of you will either, no matter what your beliefs are. Samuel Carroll is a hero. Let us not ever forget that.\" When John finished his small speech, everyone nodded in agreement and many more emotions were being shown. But it was clear that the message that the shopkeeper shared had touched each person\"s heart. Andrew felt his own eyes stinging from unshed tears. At the moment that John called Samuel a \"hero\", the angel had felt the hair on his neck raise and he shivered involuntarily. It was true. Samuel was a hero and the fact that John had actually admitted that still surprised Andrew a bit. The man was truly beginning to change and the process was a remarkable thing. Suddenly he was aware of someone beside him. He turned his head to find Tess standing there, a small smile on her face. \"I believe that man has finally seen the light, Angel Boy.\" Tess observed. Andrew glanced over at John, who had gone back to stand with his family. He then nodded. \"Yes, Tess. I think you\"re right.\" Tess noticed the contemplative look on the other angel\"s face, and she rested her hand on his shoulder. \"Are you alright, baby?\" He nodded. \"Yes. I guess I\"ve just been doing a lot of thinking. Isn\"t it amazing, Tess, how one man\"s death can impact so many people? It impacted John and Micah and now the two of them are out impacting others. It just... keeps going on.\" Tess smiled. \"God turned something bad into something truly miraculous, Andrew. He specializes in that, you know.\" Andrew just chuckled and then the two grew silent to watch the rest of the service. A little while later, the service had come to an end. Though dispersed a bit more, people still stood about, many speaking to each other in quiet tones of voice. Andrew and Tess stood and watched them for a few moments, and then they noticed a familiar figure making his way through the crowd towards them. It was Adam. When the Angel of Death reached them, he took his hat off his head and stood on the other side of Andrew. He glanced over at them with a smile. \"That was a wonderful service, wasn\"t it?\" He commented. \"Have you been here the whole time, Adam?\" Tess asked him curiously. He nodded. \"Yes, I was standing over in the distance, just under that tree over there.\" He pointed towards a large, shady tree a few yards away. Then he looked at Andrew. \"So, you finished your first assignment, Andrew. It looks like you did a wonderful job.\" Andrew just smiled. \"Well, um, I did have a lot of help.\" Adam shrugged. \"Nothing wrong about that. Everyone could use some help sometimes. What\"s bad is when you could use a bit of it, and it doesn\"t seem to be there. But fortunately for you, you shouldn\"t be experiencing that problem on your next case. That\"s what I\"m here for.\" \"You\"re staying?\" Andrew asked with surprise. \"Mm-hum.\" The Angel of Death nodded, as he shoved his hands into the pockets of his long coat. \"The Father has given me permission to work with you and Tess for a while. I\"ll get a chance to go back and do some of the old caseworking stuff again, spend time with the two of you. Also, the Father seems to think I may be able to help teach Andrew a few tricks of the trade. Whatever that means.\" He shrugged innocently. Tess snorted and shook her head. \"I know what that means. It means I\"m going to have to keep a better eye on both of you boys, or you are going to go off teaching Andrew here on the very best ways to get into mischief and irritate the supervisor.\" Adam feigned a hurt expression at this point. \"Why Tess, how could you even think such a thing? What mischief could I possibly get him or anyone else into?\" \"I\"m sure you could manage to think up a thing or two.\" Tess started to reply. She let her sentence drop though because she suddenly noticed Sarah making her way towards them. When the girl reached them, she smiled a bit sadly. \"So I guess you are leaving now.\" Sarah observed quietly. Tess nodded. \"Yes baby, we are. As a matter of fact, I was just about to tell these two that.\" She nodded her head toward Andrew and Adam. The girl shifted her view and gazed up at the Angel of Death in front of her. \"You\"re the man who was up in the loft with Andrew a few nights ago... Adam.\" She recalled his name. \"You are an angel too, aren\"t you?\" \"Yes Sarah, I am.\" He smiled and nodded. He decided though to not go into detail about the specifics of his job. Some things, he knew, were better left unsaid. She sighed. \"I wish you didn\"t have to leave.\" She told them truthfully \"I know you do. I kind of wish I didn\"t have to go too.\" Andrew replied softly. \"I like it here and Sarah, you are a wonderful friend. No one likes to leave their friends behind.\" \"Where will you go?\" She asked them. Unsure of what to say, Andrew and Adam both looked over at Tess to supply the answer. Tess smiled. \"Wherever the Father sends us. He knows where we\"re needed.\" \"To help another family maybe?\" The girl guessed. \"Perhaps.\" Adam shrugged. \"Whoever you help, they are very fortunate to have you.\" She said softly. Then she looked at each one of them. \"You won\"t forget me, will you?\" Very quickly, Andrew shook his head. \"No. Of course not, Sarah. We could never forget you. Especially me.\" He added gently. \"You are a very special young lady.\" Adam told her sincerely. \"You have so much love and understanding to give. I have only known you for a little bit, but I can see it in you already. God has given you a wonderful, loving spirit, Sarah; and I know that you are going to use it to do great things in your life.\" \"Remember that for us, baby. Alright?\" Tess told her softly. \"That and \"God loves you\". Both of those are things you should never forget.\" She nodded. \"I won\"t. I promise.\" Glancing up at the sky, Adam then sighed sadly. \"I believe it\"s time for us to go now.\" He told Tess. This did not escape the ears of neither Andrew or Sarah and when the girl heard this, she looked at Andrew sadly. \"I have to go now, Sarah.\" Andrew repeated gently. He held out his arms to her and smiled weakly. \"Do you think that I may be able to get a hug before I go?\" She nodded and quickly walked into his embrace. She wrapped her arms around him tightly. \"I love you, Andrew.\" She whispered, so only he could hear it. \"I love you too, Sarah.\" He whispered back at her, his heart overwhelmed with the love he felt come from her. When she pulled back from his embrace, she looked up at him hopefully. \"Will I see you again?\" She asked him weakly. Andrew noticed tears in the corners of her sad eyes, and he gently wiped them away with his thumbs. \"You will, Sarah. One day I will come back and see you again. I don\"t know when exactly, but I will come back someday.\" \"You promise?\" He nodded surely. \"I promise.\" Well, welcome to the next chapter. There is only one left after this one, the epilogue. Thanks to Zarz, Yva J, and Jenni-OnThisSide for the reviews for the last chapter. I\"m so glad you liked it, and yeah, I\"m even kinda sad that it\"s about over. After working on this for 8 months, I won\"t know what to do with myself. So with that, enjoy chapter 35 and I\"ll see you Thursday (hopefully) for the last one. Chapter Thirty-Five A few minutes later, Andrew and Adam were slowly walking through a field, away from the funeral scene. They were alone, for Tess had already gone on ahead and was waiting on them. They had said good bye to Sarah and then had watched as she sadly made her way back to her waiting family. Knowing the angels would be leaving, John had waved good bye to them from across the way. The entire scene had had a melancholy feel about it and even as the two angels walked away from it, the feeling still hung heavily in the air. Neither one said anything at first until Andrew glanced back behind him, then looked at Adam. \"Is it always this hard?\" He asked softly. \"No, Andrew, I don\"t think it is.\" Adam replied, seeing the look of sadness his friend wore on his face. \"The Chandlers are very special people and Sarah, I know, did make a significant impact on you. Every assignment is special in different ways. This one... this one was different, wasn\"t it?\" Andrew nodded. \"Yes. I don\"t think I\"ll ever forget these last few days.\" Adam smiled. \"I doubt you will.\" Andrew just nodded absentmindedly at this remark and some more silence followed. Finally, Andrew looked up curiously. \"Adam?\" he asked. The Angel of Death looked over at him expectantly. \"Hmm?\" \"You were a caseworker once, weren\"t you?\" Adam chuckled. \"Yes, but that was many, many years ago. I imagine that you were only just getting your feet wet in Search and Rescue then.\" \"Was Tess your supervisor too?\" He asked next. \"No... she wasn\"t.\" Adam shook his head. \"Not at first, anyway. I had a different supervisor when I first started out. But I think I my have drove her a bit crazy after a while, so eventually Tess took over.\" He smiled at the memory. Andrew\"s eyes widened at this revelation. \"You supervisor sent you away?\" \"No, I was only kidding about that part.\" Adam laughed. \"But for some reason, after my first hundred years or so in the case working department, the Father assigned me to Tess instead. I don\"t know, maybe He thought I needed a firmer hand. I never tried to actually ask Tess before.\" He grinned mischievously."]}
{"id": "ea5e7489-fda3-5483-bc22-f54dd7c67a9f", "fandoms": ["Inside Out", "Sonic the Hedgehog"], "pair": ["\"Hey, don\"t come and criticize me when you totally caused problems by jumping into action without even listening to your best friend!\" Disgust fired back, taking Sonic by surprise. \"Forgot about that mister \"I don\"t know how to reboot\"?\" \"Hey, do you see a scarf on me?\" Sonic asked while gesturing to his neck in order to prove his point. \"Didn\"t think so... and just because I messed up on that regard once doesn\"t mean I didn\"t learn from it!\" Disgust rolled her eyes, realizing this argument wasn\"t going anywhere. \"Look, this isn\"t about what is what. This is about helping Felix. I\"ve got to help him before it\"s too late!\" Seeing how she had a point and how much she seemed to care about her mission, Sonic agreed to help her out. \"You must really care about Felix being okay...\" He observed. \"I\"m his main emotion. It\"s my job to make sure he\"s alright.\" She answered her usual answer regarding what she thought about Felix; even though this entire journey did make her realize she might actually care about him just a little bit more than just being her job. \"And it\"s my job to make sure a fan of mine will be okay.\" The hedgehog answered as well before picking up Disgust from the ground and holding her in his arms. \"Hang tight!\" He said before speeding towards Dream Productions. \"Do you always carry people you\"re helping like this?\" Disgust asked, being carried bride-style by Sonic. \"Hey, you want me to grab your hand and might accidently pull it out?\" He asked, making Disgust almost puke just from the thought alone. \"Like I thought; now hold on!\" He told her to tighten her grip as soon as they got passed the islands, picking up the pace now that he could run more smoothly. In no time, Sonic arrived at Dream productions, the place where Felix\"s dreams are being produced. \"Here we are!\" He said while putting Disgust down, who was trying to regain her sense of direction from the fast travelling she has just went through. \"You okay?\" \"I was just carried away by the fastest thing alive, you do the math.\" She said annoyingly, thinking that the answer was obvious. \"Sorry.\" Sonic apologized with a light chuckle. \"Well anyway, here you go. Dream Productions. Do you need any other help?\" \"I might. You know where they shoot Felix\"s dreams, right?\" Disgust asked. \"Sure.\" Sonic nodded. \"They aske me to make small cameos in some of Felix\"s dreams every once in a while.\" \"Ugh...\" Disgust sighed. \"That \"Sonic Generations\" one was painful!\" She said. \"Felix waited so long for that game and you guys... trolled him; for lack of a better term.\" \"That can happen. Anyway, what do you need me to do?\" He asked. \"There\"s a girl in Imagination Land with purple hair called Shantae. Bring her here as I will need both of your help in order to take over Felix\"s dream and talk to him.\" She told him determinately. \"Tell her Felix needs her help.\" \"I\"m on it!\" Sonic gave Disgust a thumbs up before running off towards Imagination Land. Once Sonic was gone, Disgust looked at the big shiny movie studio like place. She took a deep breath before going inside. This place was huge with tons of activity everywhere as countless creatures from Felix\"s mind were walking around. They were either carrying film equipment or just talking among themselves about what was up for today\"s shoot. While walking around, Disgust noticed several posters for dreams Felix had in the past. She had a fond memory of the one called \"The First Time\", which Felix had before his first date back when he was in high-school. There were also ones like \"Some Action Film\" and \"The Day School Exploded\", which Disgust thought were too crazy and action oriented for her. They at least gave Felix something to be joking about, which she took as a plus. After a bit more searching, Disgust eventually found the door leading into the shooting studio. Without wasting anymore time, she went inside. The first thing Disgust saw upon entering the studio was the makeup department hard at work on the stars of tonight\"s dream. The makeup artists were apparently not the best of their kind as Disgust was ready to jump in and do the work herself, but the call of the director announcing the start of filming reminded her that she was on a mission. As the director was handing everyone their scripts and the set was being quickly constructed, Disgust went into hiding so that no one could see her and attempt to stop her. If \"Inside Out\" represented this place faithfully, then she shouldn\"t show herself or else trouble would ensue. \"Where\"s that hedgehog already...?\" She muttered before a small breeze greeted her back. \"Found the girl!\" Sonic announced silently as he showed Disgust Shantae, who\"s hair was terribly messed up, probably due to Sonic\"s running. \"So, what do we need to do in order to save Felix?\" Shantae asked while fixing her hair. \"I need to get into his dream. To do that, I\"ll need to hold the entire crew back so no one will prevent me from showing up in the dream; that\"s where you two come in.\" Disgust explained her plan. \"Don\"t really hurt them; just keep them away from the frame and myself.\" \"Got it!\" Sonic declared before turning towards Shantae. \"Are you ready?\" \"Ret-2-go!\" She replied happily while shaking her hips. Sonic had no idea how to react to what she just said, but he smiled and nodded at her anyway as he understood it was a positive response. Soon enough, both Sonic and Shantae jumped into action from behind where they hid alongside Disgust, and both started running at similar speeds. \"I\"ll distract them so you could get a clear shot.\" Sonic explained his plan. Once the girl with the purple hair nodded, the hedgehog sped up and started running all across the studio while Shantae used her hair in order to whip some of the distracted members unconscious. Back in the headquarters; Anger, Fear and Sadness were still looking at this giant statue of Felix which grew right near the headquarters window. They kept eyeing it susceptibly as Fear seemed to notice the statue was almost reaching Felix\"s brain. Throughout the entire time, Joy didn\"t leave his post near the console. If Disgust told them to act as if they were in regular dream duty, he\"ll do as he was told. Even if Disgust got herself sucked back into the long-term which they have just escaped, he believed there was a good enough reason for it. She knew what to do, she always knew, and he trusted her plan even if he was positive it was insane. Just then, the screen showing Felix\"s dreams showed up and Joy didn\"t expect to see what he was just seeing on it. True, he didn\"t know what to expect anymore with everything that\"s happened, but what he saw right now was all kinds of wired. The screen showed Sonic and Shantae beating up people from Felix\"s college it seemed. Why? What was going on down there? Was Felix being self-aware caused his dreams to get all over-the-top and not make any sense? Once the crew was out of her way thanks to Sonic and Shantae, Disgust ran towards the camera. She took off the reality distortion filter from the camera lance in order for the dream to show herself and not someone else that wasn\"t her. Joy was a bit surprised to see a broccoli so close to the camera, and was even more surprised to suddenly see Disgust in the middle of the frame. \"Guys, it\"s Disgust!\" He called to the other emotions, who came to the console as fast as they could once they heard what Joy said. \"What is she doing in there!?\" Anger asked, having no idea what was Felix\"s main emotion thinking to herself. \"Felix? Felix!\" Disgust started yelling at the camera. \"Is she trying to wake him up?\" Fear asked. \"Why would she do that?\" Sadness was the next to question Disgust\"s motives, being confused as everybody else were. \"She has completely gone insane!\" Anger yelled, slamming his fist on the not-operative console. \"Guys, I don\"t think she\"s trying to wake Felix up.\" Joy said, gathering the rest of the emotions\" attention. \"I think she\"s trying to talk to him...\" \"Felix!\" Disgust kept screaming at the camera. \"Come on, talk to me you guy!\" Disgust kept fighting and calling Felix names until it seemed like something was responding to her calls. \"That\"s it, Felix! Listen to me!\" She said with a smile on her face. \"I have something to tell you, so show me that boy face of yours so that I could tell it straight to it!\" Felix opened his eyes and was surprised to find himself in a white room with nothing in it, wearing different clothes than the ones he went to sleep with. He looked around himself in order to try and understand what was going on, until he realized a voice was calling him. When the teen turned around in the direction of the voice he found something resembling a screen floating before him, a green broccoli like thing with a blue scarf and a respectable amount of make up looking at him. \"Hello, Felix.\" You still here? Good. That means it wasn\"t THAT crazy... I have not much to say about this one except for the fact that I know I ended it on such an evil cliffhanger. Hope you guys enjoyed this! Leave a review if you got something to say! I think this is probably my favorite chapter in this story. It was fun to write and plan out. Hope you will like it as well! Enjoy and please review! Felix was looking at the thing which was talking to him with a combination of awe and confusion. What was this thing, and how did it know him? \"What is this place? What are you?\" He asked in order to get some answers. \"This is your dream.\" The green creature answered, its voice made it clear that it was a female. \"And I, surprised you didn\"t piece it together by this point, am your main emotion.\" She told him, hoping this conversation would go well. Felix thought about what she said for a few seconds before understanding what she was. \"My main emotion? Like, Inside Out got it all right? Things like you DO exist inside out minds!?\" He asked with excitement in his voice. \"Yes!\" He shouted while punching the air. \"I figured out things like you existed! This movie made WAY too much sense in order to not be real!\" He said. \"Yeah, yeah, I know that you think you\"re brilliant and everything right now,\" Disgust cut his happy speech. \"but the fact you thought about this idea in the first place, that everything shown in the movie was actually a thing, caused you to lose us.\" She told him. \"What?\" Felix asked once he heard what had happened. \"Once you started thinking the movie actually represents the human mind and started telling it to everyone, we started to lose control over you until we eventually became absolute.\" Disgust explained. \"We were dragged from our headquarters inside of your mind into your long-term memory because you suddenly started to produce memories of your own. We fought to get back into your mind because a human can\"t control his emotions in a consecutive manner.\" \"Wait, you mean how I acted yesterday, with Britney at college and everything, that was because I couldn\"t control my own emotions?\" He asked, suddenly realizing how he was behaving strangely ever since he got to college last morning; quiet and robotic when alone, but all over the place once being talked to. Disgust nodded. \"You can\"t manipulate the levels of joy, sadness, fear, anger and disgust on your own. And without us to be there and control you, you started to spun all of these strange personality islands that started filling your head.\" She continued to tell everything that\"s happened to the fascinated human. \"Just now, there is something that\"s apparently trying to reach your brain. I don\"t know what it would do to you, but I don\"t want to find out...\" Felix, along with the rest of his emotions back at the headquarters, watched Disgust\"s explanation of the situation. The emotions couldn\"t believe Disgust tried, and succeeded to talk to her human, something that hasn\"t been done before, while Felix himself was trying to digest everything he had just heard. He was the first human to not being controlled by those emotions. That must have meant something, he thought. If he could have broken the emotions\" control over him, then he could know how to eventually control his own emotions, right? \"So, come on Felix.\" Disgust said. \"Let us back in your head so we could help you.\" She told him with a smile, causing the rest of the emotions to watch in disbelief as Disgust\"s plan seemed to have worked. But Felix\"s answer wasn\"t what they were all expecting... \"No\" \"What!?\" Disgust asked in shock, the rest of the emotions were surprised as well. \"Why should I be controlled by a bunch of tiny creatures that up to this point were all believed to be imaginary? If I was able to think, feel and create memories without you, there\"s got to be a reason for it, right? Maybe it will take a little more time to control my emotions to different levels, but I can probably handle it...\" He replied with a cocky smile, thinking he didn\"t need his emotions if he was able to get rid of them. \"Don\"t you understand that your brain could be damaged!?\" Disgust shouted at him. She couldn\"t believe he was acting like that when she just told him he was in danger. \"Once again, I managed to make you guys useless. I think I can handle that thing in my brain with no problems.\" At that point, Disgust was starting to feel sorry that she gave Felix his cockiness and somewhat self-pride. \"You just don\"t get it that your brain could get hurt really badly?\" She asked again. \"We are trying to help you! It\"s our job as your emotions to help you and protect you from any kind of danger!\" She exclaimed. \"But that\"s all there\"s to it, right?\" Felix asked, starting to get impatient with Disgust. \"It\"s just about doing your job, isn\"t it? You don\"t care about how I turn out or if I succeed in something. You don\"t care about me as a person, you just care about doing your job, don\"t you?\" He asked. \"You and your other emotion friends just care about doing your part and that\"s it, correct? Why would I want you carless emotions to control me?\" Felix spat at Disgust, who quickly answered him. \"OF COURSE WE CARE ABOUT YOU, YOU IDIOT!\" Her scream caught Felix, along with the rest of the emotions, unprepared. The emotions themselves could have also sworn that Disgust has mentioned all of them, counting herself as well this time around. Following her scream, Disgust took a deep breath before explaining herself. \"Remember the time when the teacher failed you on that test because he thought you copied from another girl? It was Anger who made you fight so you could get the score you deserved and also proved the teacher he was wrong!\" Anger blinked when he heard Disgust tell the story. He remembered how furious he was about it, as Felix studied hard for that test. \"Remember the time you were afraid to go with your drunk friends in their car and was saved because of it? It was Fear who made you consider getting inside that car because he didn\"t want you to die in your teens!\" Disgust continued, making Fear remember the night he saved Felix\"s life by making him avoid that car ride which was later reported to end in disaster. \"Remember when you failed that horrid History test and everyone came to cheer you up and tell you it wasn\"t the end of the world? It was Sadness who helped comfort you so and made your friends tell you it was nothing and that life goes on!\" Sadness was starting to tear up a bit, getting emotional from remembering his contribution. \"Remember that time when you got an A+ on your final project in high-school and everyone cheered for you when you presented it? It was Joy who made you feel happy about yourself and all that you managed accomplish!\" Joy found himself smiling when Disgust mentioned his name, making him seem important to Felix\"s life. The emotions watched Disgust\"s speech with their jaw dropped. They did do all of these things because they loved Felix and wanted him to lead a long and happy life, and they couldn\"t thank Disgust enough for making him realize that. Once all of that was done, Disgust took another deep breath in order to prepare herself for what she was about to say next... \"Remember the time you were picked at in school? The times when you just couldn\"t catch a break? The times you thought the world was against you? The times you were sick in your bed? The times you just couldn\"t believe how stupid the world could be, and you just pushed all of these things away without giving any of it a second thought and maybe even threw a sarcastic remark towards all of those bad things because you knew you were better than that?\" She asked Felix, shouting the last few words. \"Can you guess who was there for you throughout all of those times?\" Disgust attacked, not noticing a tear was actually showing up in one of her eyes. \"Do you know who lead your emotions through your long-term memory in order to help you? Do you know who volunteered to go back there once coming back didn\"t help us? Do you know who was there for you ever since the moment you were born?\" Felix and the rest of the emotions looked at Disgust without the ability to believe what she was saying. Felix realized how much his emotions did care a lot for him, while the other four emotions realized Disgust might not have said the truth about a certain matter. \"It was me, Felix. Throughout it all.\" She admitted to be there for him ever since he came to be. \"Everything the other emotions did for you, I did times ten. I assigned them roles, I thought about the basic way to come at any situation, I did all of these things so that you would have the best life anyone has ever had! I admit, I treated you as a job at the beginning; but once you grew up and we came across more people, I realized that you are WAY more than that. I worked hard every day to make your life great because believe me or not, you deserve it, Felix. You deserve it a lot more than some of the morons we came across throughout the years and I want you to know it! If I did it just for the sake of doing a job, I would have left all that \"fair\" stuff to Anger and won\"t give any other action you do a second thought. But you\"re the best human I could have ever been asked to lead; and I\"m not going to let that little sassiness I put inside of you get in my way of saving you!\" Disgust breathed heavily from her long speech. Felix and the emotions stared at her catching her breath as the emotions noticed the console was slowly starting to regain color. \"Please let us back in your head, Felix.\" Disgust said as she fell to her knees, probably due to exhaustion, her eyes filled with tears. \"We care a lot about you and we must save you. I must save you... because I love you, Felix.\" All the sudden, the console at the headquarters regained its full color much to the others\" amazement. Sadness quickly pulled the memory which was stuck inside of it out, causing Felix to start crying, realizing that his emotions would go above and beyond for him. Felix woke up in his apartment, realizing he was probably crying in his sleep. Fear quickly got on the controls and made Felix get out of bed and turn on his laptop. Once the computer was up and running, Felix entered his Reddit account and quickly deleted the post he had written earlier, happy that there were no views for it after he posted it. When the message informing him about the successful removal of his post, it was obvious to Felix\"s emotions that their problem was finally solved. With a small smile granted to him by Joy, Felix headed back to bed and returned to sleep. Now that Felix was back under their control, the emotions sighed in relief, especially when the giant Felix statue along with the rest of the uncharacteristic personality islands started to crumble and fall apart into the memory dump, where their ruins will remain forgotten forever. After a few short moments, Disgust came back to the headquarters through the same hatch day-dreams are coming from. Once she got out of there, the rest of the emotions hugged her tight for all she has done. \"Okay people; I know I saved our lives and everything, but please let me go.\" She said in her usual snobby tone, but she didn\"t spare her team from a smile full of gratitude. \"Good job, everyone. I\"ll continue dream duty, you go get some rest. You all deserve it.\" There were no complains as the rest of the emotions headed back to their room while Disgust returned to her position at the center of Felix\"s console, about to watch the dreams made for tonight. As the dreams played on, Disgust leaned back in her chair and started applying nail-polish to her nails while occasionally picking at what was on. Though the dreams were wired and not much to her taste, she couldn\"t really complain about them. They were Felix\"s dreams, and what made him sleep well rolled with her. I\"m getting this out of the way first; that \"I love you\" part is NOT and I repeat, NOT meant to be romantic in any way, shape, or form. This is meant to be more of a mother\"s love or like a big sister. NO SHIPPING INTENDED! Now with that out of the way, we\"re almost done! We\"ve got only one more chapter to go and it will be more of an epilouge than anything else. With that said, I really hope you enjoyed this chapter, because like I said, I really enjoyed writing it! See you next time and waiting to hear your thoughts in the reviews!", "Shadow didn\"t argue as he quickly got out of his bed and ran as fast as he could, which was pretty fast as he was born with super speed. Many considered this ability of his a combination of his father\"s great athletic skills, which showed in his impressive stamina, and his mother\"s fast actions and quick thinking. It was always assumed that the baby hedgehog would possess the same skill as his older brother. But as of now, it was still a mystery. Right now, the baby was cuddled in his mother\"s arms, the fire not bothering his peaceful dreams. Once the family escaped the burning house, the mother gave Shadow her youngest son. \"Here, Shadow. Protect him,\" she told him. \"What... Why? Where are you going?\" Shadow asked, not knowing what was going on or what was about to happen. \"We are going to try and stop this fire,\" the father answered his son before he dropped to his knee in order to look into Shadow\"s eyes. \"Shadow, in case we won\"t make it, we want you to promise us you will take care of your little brother. Help him grow; we are counting on you,\" he said. \"But... but you will make it, right?\" he asked as tears started forming in his eyes while he was holding his sleeping brother close to him. \"We sure hope, son,\" their mother said as she leaned to kiss Shadow on his check and the baby hedgehog\"s forehead. \"Right now, get out of here. We don\"t want you to get hurt,\" their father said before Shadow nodded at his parents and ran away with his brother in his hands. Seconds became minutes, minutes became hours, but there was no sign of the two hedgehogs after their attempt to stop the fire that burned down their house. The curious Shadow eventually returned home, his baby brother still sleeping, to find there was no home left. Where a house once stood was now a pile of burned ashes, and there was no sign of his parents anywhere. The only thing that was left was the hedgehogs\" father\"s brown scarf, caught on a scorched piece of wood. One would think a 4-year-old wouldn\"t understand where his parents disappeared to under those circumstances, but Shadow understood well enough what his parents\" fate was. He used to think that his parents were strong hedgehogs. Based on the stories his father told him every night, how could both of them lose to something as pathetic as a fire when they dealt with such great dangers in the past? As the tears started to fall from his eyes, Shadow noticed his brother awoke with a soft yawn. Poor kid, completely oblivious to what happened, and he will never know his parents outside of a few stories about them. Shadow looked at the baby hedgehog in his arms as his parents\" words from last night played in his mind. \"We want you to take care of your little brother.' The words echoed in his head as he picked up the brown scarf that lay on the ground near where their home once stood. Shadow closed his eyes for a few seconds before he addressed his brother. \"I will protect you, Sonic. I won\"t let anything bad happen to you.\" A few years later... Shadow was getting impatient. Sonic should have been back by now. It had been a few weeks since he left and it was dangerous out there. True, his younger brother was now fifteen, but that didn\"t mean he couldn\"t find danger. In fact, he seemed to enjoy danger, whether he was ready for it or not. After that terrible night a few years back, Shadow has become very protective of his brother, despite him being annoying him to no end. While Shadow still suffered from the same loss that haunted him since childhood, Sonic didn\"t seem to really care. Shadow assumed this had something to do with Sonic not really knowing their parents, but there was a line as to how much you could push something and hide behind silly jokes and fake pride. Someone who lost his parents, whether he knew them or not, couldn\"t be a wise-cracker who speaks sarcasm as a second language forever. Shadow promised that he would make Sonic a stronger person so that he could defend himself when the time comes. Shadow has had to fend for them both over the years, protecting Sonic from any harm that came their way and making sure both could live a proper life. But Shadow believed that Sonic also needed to fight for himself, an idea the younger hedgehog seemed to support when it was brought up to him. When Sonic was nine, Shadow started training him in battle. While Sonic got hurt a lot thanks to Shadow\"s \"no mercy\" method of training, he never gave up. He always looked up to Shadow as a hero because of the many times Shadow stood up for him while things got rough, and he knew that these training sessions were crucial to his survival. And it had actually sounded fun to Sonic in the beginning. Shadow would mention every once in a while that their father was a weak hedgehog, and that both Sonic and he would be stronger than what their father was. When Sonic started training, Shadow put their father\"s scarf around Sonic\"s neck. \"Right now, you are as weak as father was. When you prove to me that you are strong enough, I will take it off of you.\" Those were the words that kicked off Sonic\"s training, followed by an unhealthy amount of punches and kicks. Because of Sonic\"s strong will, Shadow never went easy on his younger brother. He kicked him, punched him, pushed him to the ground, and threw him all around. It was hard for Shadow to do at first, but then he realized this was the best way to care for Sonic, or so he thought. The black hedgehog would never let Sonic meet any new locals and make friends. Shadow also never hung out with him other than training. It was just the cave they lived in, training, and food. If they wanted to be strong, they must survive without distractions. Over the years, the amount of bandages on Sonic\"s body kept growing and growing. From his legs to his arms, he was almost covered with those things from all the training and beating he went through. Yet, Sonic didn\"t mind; he would never give up and he would be strong and make his older brother proud. At least, that\"s what he thought back then. After a few years of training, Sonic started going through what Shadow could only assume was a \"rebellious teen\" phase. He would disobey Shadow a lot more, he started to develop a sharp tongue towards his brother, often mimicking him or making jokes at his expense, and he just started to run everywhere whenever he got the chance. While Shadow still held the incredible speed he was gifted with at birth, he wouldn\"t use it much, if at all. Sonic, on the other hand, used it for almost everything. At the beginning, Shadow didn\"t mind. Sonic had even developed an attack using his speed where he would crawl into a ball and move incredibly fast for a few seconds, resulting in damage for whatever stood in its path. But when Sonic\"s curiosity grew and he wanted to see more of the world they lived in, he started using it to run away from their cave often, disobeying Shadow in the process. Of course, while Shadow considered this running away, Sonic mostly referred to his outing as \"letting off steam\", something Shadow wasn\"t happy with, especially when Sonic told him that he met friends. Shadow believed everything Sonic needed was Shadow himself and his training. There was no need for the rest of the world. At the beginning, there were no arguments; but as the years went on and Sonic wanted to leave the cave, he started talking back to Shadow. Their opinions often clashed and not a single training session went by without a fight. \"The world is a dangerous place, Sonic. You aren\"t strong enough to make it out there,\" Shadow would always tell him. \"How do you know, exactly? All you do is rot in this cave,\" Sonic responded one day. \"From what I\"ve seen, the world is pretty awesome and nothing I can\"t handle; it even has some nice animals out there.\" \"You mean the fox freak with the two tails and that big red idiot you keep hanging out with for some reason?\" Shadow asked. \"Hey! Don\"t call my friends that!\" \"Friends?\" Shadow reacted with laughter. \"You don\"t need friends. They do nothing but hold you back and cause you troubles.\" \"That\"s a lie!\" Sonic argued. \"The only reason you think this is because you don\"t have friends of your own, because you are so certain that you are better than everybody else!\" \"I know that\"s not what you want to hear, but that\"s the truth. Friends are nothing but a distraction from the goal. And if you keep hanging out with these worthless freaks, you won\"t go anywhere in your life and they will make you weaker than what you are now,\" Shadow replied coldly. Sonic felt like he had heard enough about Shadow\"s hatred towards his friends, who had done nothing bad to Shadow to deserve such treatment. Shadow never even officially met Sonic\"s friends. He\"d only caught sight of them a few times when Sonic walked back home with them. In a moment of rage, Sonic kicked Shadow in the back, sending him flying through the cave they were living in. Shadow was surprised by the attack. Sonic never attacked him outside of training. It was true that they would fight sometimes, but it was never Sonic who started it. When the black hedgehog looked at his younger brother again, he saw the hatred in Sonic\"s eyes. That definitely didn\"t excuse the attack in Shadow\"s opinion. \"You want to learn like this? Fine by me,\" Shadow said before he rushed at Sonic, sending countless punches towards his chest at a fast pace. The blue hedgehog fell to his knees from the pain he was suffering. He did manage to look up in order to see Shadow looking at him with an angry look. \"You dare to attack me? After all I\"ve done for you?\" he asked as Sonic also dropped to his hands on the floor. \"After all the caring I did for you, all the training I put you through to make you a strong hedgehog... and you turn your back on me to stand up for that useless bunch you call friends.\" Sonic could feel the blood coursing through his body. \"Pathetic.\" That last word was it. Sonic curled from his position into a ball of blue light and just rolled around in place for a few seconds. Then, with a motion so fast that even Shadow was surprised by it, he rammed into his brother\"s head until he bounced off the cave\"s ceiling back towards the floor and rolled right into Shadow\"s back. Sonic never used this attack he had invented for more than a few seconds, but something kept him going this time. Whatever it was, it served as a great power source for the young hedgehog because for the first time ever, he was giving Shadow a run for his money. The black hedgehog didn\"t even know how to react. Sonic just kept going at him without stopping. Shadow knew he and Sonic were fast but this surpassed any top speed they have ever achieved. Eventually, Shadow couldn\"t help it and he fell to the ground, beaten by his \"weak\" younger brother. Sonic stopped rolling and looked at the lying figure in front of him. \"How\"s that for being weak?\" Sonic asked. \"All these years, I suffered because of your training, but I kept going so that I could be as great as you. I did everything in my power to make you proud... but it never satisfied you,\" Sonic spoke through his heavy breathing. \"Am I strong enough now, Shadow? Because it looks like I did a number on you right now, oh great big brother.\" He managed a smirk when Shadow started to show some senses of recovery. Shadow looked at Sonic with a look of shock and anger. He wanted to say something, but couldn\"t. When Sonic walked back to the cave entrance, Shadow still hadn\"t spoken a word regarding what just happened. \"I\"m leaving,\" Sonic eventually said. \"I think my training is over, now that the so called master has been defeated.\" The blue hedgehog stood by the entrance. He looked at the rain that just started falling, as if the sky had heard their argument and was trying to cool the tension, before he looked back at Shadow. \"Don\"t look for me. I\"ll be with my weak friends. And I\"m keeping dad\"s scarf, if you don\"t mind. I\"ve grown attached to it.\" And with those last words, the younger sibling was no longer there. That was the last time Shadow had seen Sonic. He never came back, even though Shadow was sure he would. Shadow\"s impatience with his brother rose after those few weeks passed. After their last conversation and fight, the black hedgehog preferred to say he had nothing to do with Sonic... but his parents\" words always kept bugging him. \"We want you to take care of your little brother.' Eventually, Shadow gave in to his dead parents\" request and one morning, he was off to look for Sonic. Shadow ran across all the forests and structures filling the world he lived in. Looking for Sonic proved to be tougher than he thought it was going to be. There were no signs of the blue hedgehog anywhere, but Shadow didn\"t stop looking. He would find his brother. He wasn\"t weak. Before the black hedgehog even realized it, darkness filled the sky and night fell. For the first time in years, Shadow had to sleep somewhere other than the cave he considered home. He wouldn\"t admit it out loud, but at that moment, he did feel weak. No parents, his little brother rebelled against him, and he had put himself completely out of his comfort zone while trying to fulfill a wish made by his dead parents. Even if he never would say it out loud, he felt like he should be wearing the scarf now, not Sonic. The next morning Shadow felt a bit off, as he was woken from his sleep by a loud mechanic sound. His senses weren\"t all awake yet, so he couldn\"t figure out what the thing exactly was other than bad news. However, there was one thing he did hear that he would recognize anywhere at any time. \"Seriously, Eggman? You still think you can take us down?\" That voice, it was Sonic! Shadow pushed out of the bush he was standing behind to reveal an open area at the bottom of the mountain. He recognized Sonic, who still wore the bandages and scarf, and noticed he was facing a rather large blue and yellow round robot with two massive legs that could crush anyone and anything standing beneath them and two projectile hands. The robot was controlled by an overweight human with red clothes and a brown mustache that really stood out that sat where the robot\"s head should be. Alongside Sonic stood the orange two-tailed fox with the goggles and buff red echidna that Shadow recognized, but there was also a pink female hedgehog holding a hammer and dressed in red clothes that he had never seen before. \"I\"m not thinking, Sonic. I know I can take you down!\" Eggman yelled before he ordered the robot to charge in for an attack using wheels that were built inside its legs in order to move. All four friends have dodged the attack, two of them evading to each side. The echidna was the first to recover and charge at the robot, but was hurt when the robot quickly spun in his direction and knocked him into the air with a strong blow. Once the echidna landed, the robot grabbed him and launched the hand holding him in the direction of the pink hedgehog and grabbed her as well. With two of the four friends caught, Sonic and the fox found themselves in a situation they didn\"t know how to get out of. The fox quickly spun his two tails, propelling him into the sky as he flew towards the robot with what appeared to be bombs in his hands. He threw the bombs at the robot but their small size didn\"t seem to even faze the large metallic invention. \"You really think your tiny bombs can stop my robot?\" the human teased as he sent the robot\"s other arm after the fox. The arm punched him, knocking him out of the air before the fox was caught in the same arm as the other two friends. Sonic started to get a bit stressed. He needed to destroy the robot without hurting his friends. And to add to his problems, a new robot appeared in the area. This one looked exactly like Sonic, only robotic. \"Ho! Ho! Ho!\" Eggman laughed. \"Like my new creation? I built him after our last fight a few days ago. I call him... Metal Sonic!\" \"If you think this faker is going to stop me, think again!\" Sonic said with some confidence before he rolled into his ball form and, after a bit of a wind up, zoomed all around the area. While getting to the incredible speed he achieved the last time he used this attack, Sonic tried to aim at the arm holding his friends first. Saving them was his top priority. Once he reached the speed he wanted and headed to the arm, Metal Sonic stopped him with a swipe that sent Sonic to the ground. Shadow kept watching from afar as the fight went on. Sonic was doing well in terms of surviving attacks, but not in terms of making this fight end with a victory. Shadow noticed Sonic wasn\"t focusing on the fight with the robots, but more on saving his friends from the giant robot\"s clutches. Shadow knew what he had to do. He had to save his brother. Sonic kept trying to get past Metal Sonic, who stood in his way each time the hedgehog tried to avoid him, but the robot just didn\"t give up. Eventually, it seemed as if Metal Sonic got tired of the hedgehog he was modeled after. Metal Sonic charged at him with an incredible speed and grabbed him by the neck. Sonic struggled to get out of the grasp he was held in and destroy the robot. He suddenly felt the grip loosen and the robot take damage. Sonic, now loose from his robot counter-part\"s grab, noticed Shadow fighting Metal Sonic. The blue hedgehog didn\"t question the presence of his brother out of nowhere as he charged his ball form again, freed his friends, destroyed the large robot with his fast attack which caused Eggman to retreat and managed to alert Shadow just in time before he dashed right through Metal Sonic, causing it to break. Sonic stopped his spinning shortly after hitting his metallic version. \"Are you guys okay?\" He turned to ask his three friends after he got up from the harsh ground. All of his friends nodded at him with a smile. After that, Sonic turned his head to see Shadow dusting himself off from the fight. \"Glad you decided to help out, Shadow,\" he called to his brother, smiling at him when Shadow turned his head to look at him. \"Hmph,\" was the first word that came out of his mouth. \"Now you see how much trouble these guys are?\" he asked while pointing at Sonic\"s friends. \"Come home, forget about them and accept the fact that they are weakening you instead of empowering you.\" Sonic was, at the moment, in a loss for words. \"I can\"t believe you,\" he eventually said. \"First you come to help us out and a second later you are the old grumpy and annoying you again.\" \"The \"grumpy and annoying\" self just saved your butt, little brother.\" \"Big deal,\" Sonic shrugged that comment off. \"We could have taken them down even without you.\" \"Don\"t try to make yourself look good, Sonic. Your friends know how much of a loser you are. Don\"t try to show off in front of them now. I also see you still have the scarf. Figures you would keep the symbol of your weakness wherever you go,\" Shadow continued to taunt, making Sonic angrier and angrier by the second. But before Sonic did something hasty that wouldn\"t solve anything, he relaxed. \"You know what? Forget it,\" Sonic told his brother before turning to his group of friends. \"Come on, guys. Let\"s get out of here.\" He motioned for his friends to follow him. Before all four completely disappeared from Shadow\"s eyesight, Sonic spoke a few final words to him. \"When you feel like talking, like the strong hero that you are, come find me.\" And with those words, Sonic joined his friends as they left the clearing, leaving Shadow behind again. He didn\"t care for his older brother anymore after this, and if the next time they met would be anything like this time, Sonic would probably show no remorse. Sonic still wore the scarf to respect the parents he never knew. He valued the piece of brown cloth since it was the only this left of his parents. If it was truly to be worn by the weak, Shadow should have worn it by now. Deep down, Shadow knew he was the one that should be wearing the scarf. But he would never admit it to himself. A few more weeks passed since that encounter, and the two brothers hadn\"t spoken nor seen each other again since then. Sonic couldn\"t take Shadow\"s massive ego and vendetta against his friends while Shadow couldn\"t stand Sonic\"s easy going trust in anyone and his friendly spirit to anyone but himself. One day though, when Shadow was travelling along the woods near his cave, he heard voices. When he checked out the source of the noise, he noticed Sonic and his three friends heading inside a temple and locking themselves in, so that they could escape that metallic Sonic and the old man from that other day. Shadow just looked from where he stood. He couldn\"t care less now about Sonic, but if one day the two brothers met again, Shadow decided he would confront his younger sibling about the events. And if that day will lead to violence, so be it. THE END That was... interesting to write... mostly because I had no idea which direction I should take this. I settled for a more dramatic tone than what\"s in the cartoon(Which I think is great, if we are on the subject) because it just felt better for this idea. I tried my best to make sure this fits with the game, a not so simple task because there is nothing there about Shadow, but I think I managed and am happy with how this turned out. Hope you liked it as well! Another special thanks to daisygirl101 for betaing this! Thanks for reading and please leave a feedback if you want to say something. Good, bad, I accept it all."]}
