How about they go back to the house? Head Guard: Back to the house? But then there wouldnt be enough people out looking for the thief! Come on people! We need everyone out here looking for the statue! Now lets go! Guard 5: How about I just go back to the house and you guys go look for the statue? Head Guard: (Hesitates while contemplating the query) ...Alright, you head back to the house. You four! That way! You three! With me! Guard 1: Why does he get to go back!

Be a part of what God\u2019s doing, but don\u2019t drop your faith in the process. First and foremost, keep standing on His promises. His word will work when miracles are happening and when they\u2019re not. His Word will work in the daytime and in the dark. His word will work for anyone who will put it to work\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re 12 or 92. Remember this: Faith\u2014the everyday kind of faith you use for living\u2014doesn\u2019t come from seeing miracles or even seeing Jesus Himself. It comes by Hearing God\u2019s word. Turn to Romans 10:17 it says this: \u201cSo then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\u201d  Turn to John 20:24-29 it says this: \u201cBut Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came."}

When you do that, the part of you that is like God rises up and gets stronger. Am I saying you should avoid seeing miracles? Absolutely not! Enjoy them all you want. Be a part of what God\u2019s doing, but don\u2019t drop your faith in the process. First and foremost, keep standing on His promises. His word will work when miracles are happening and when they\u2019re not. His Word will work in the daytime and in the dark. His word will work for anyone who will put it to work\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re 12 or 92. Remember this: Faith\u2014the everyday kind of faith you use for living\u2014doesn\u2019t come from seeing miracles or even seeing Jesus Himself. It comes by Hearing God\u2019s word. Turn to Romans 10:17 it says this: \u201cSo then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\u201d  Turn to John 20:24-29 it says this: \u201cBut Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said unto him, we have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger and behold my hands; and reach hither they hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing."}

We are overpopulated as it is, and a fetus is apart of a woman\u2019s body, and they can\u2019t have an abortion if they wait too long because then it\u2019s considered a baby and can feel pain. If the lady doesn\u2019t want to be a mother, let her do what she wants with her body. But if she keeps coming back then sterilize her so she can stop wasting the abortion doctor\u2019s time.

But Bush is a puppet with literacy problems. However, I like what he did in Afghanistan, but then he went to Iraq\u2026what? I thought Bin Laden\u2019s men attacked my country. Saddam was doing his own thing, it may have been bad but we had no business to take over his country. He may have been a horrible leader, but that\u2019s his problem and his peoples\u2019 problem. Or it was. We couldn\u2019t find Bin Laden so we went after the nearest Muslim. Bush\u2019s daddy should have killed Saddam a long time ago, but I\u2019ll give his Father some credit, he probably did send a sniper out who failed. It happens. But we should be finding the guys who hit our country, not someone who may have owned some powerful weapons. Saddam was smart enough not to attack America, so we went over and attacked him. No self-defense, we were just bullies in a playground. If Bush had said, \u201cSaddam is a bad man, lets get \u2018em Johnny!\u201d We would have all shaken our heads and this mess wouldn\u2019t have happened. And because of 9/11, all these safety measures have been put up on airplanes. Oh yeah, I\u2019m going to take over an airplane with a razor blade.

It\u2019s a quote from one of our founding fathers. A quote long forgotten. This country is hardly free, it has rules and restrictions and laws, so why make it less free? But of course, people have way too much fear; they have to get over the fact that sometimes countries are attacked. It\u2019ll never go away as long as people are here, so don\u2019t bother, just live life as much as possible. We are restricted by our religions, the government and reality, so why restrict it even more with security? Some security is good, but don\u2019t overdo. Political parties, everyone has them and we\u2019re no different. We have two main parties, Republicans and Democrats. Republicans make the rich richer and the poor poorer (my family is feeling this effect) but at the same time Democrats over tax and get the government too much cash. Both have problems. We shouldn\u2019t even have political parties. It causes hatred between them, we should vote for who we want because of who we want and not the party they are in. We should have listened to George Washington when he warned us against political parties."}

We shouldn\u2019t have to go on diets, just make sure we don\u2019t overdo on the high fat, high calorie, and high carbohydrate foods. And we must have some sort of exercise activity. Or at least exercise somewhat. Get yourself moving. I\u2019m being a little hypocritical here because I stay inside all day, but I am planning on obtaining an exercise activity by taking a martial arts class. And I do move around quite a bit when I\u2019m not online. I walk around when listening to music; I do push-ups in the morning or at night. It doesn\u2019t have to be sports to get us moving, just something. But because we all can\u2019t control our urges, we eat \u201clike a dog that feeds until he suffers\u201d (Bad Religion, \u201cHow much is enough?\u201d). We must learn to be strong; we have to in order to stop the predicted future for America, one where 100% of Americans will be obese. And then there is sex. Sex is overrated. It\u2019s a process of making babies, but all the movies make it seem so great, late night TV is all about it. It\u2019s a natural process let it go people. I don\u2019t care how much fun you have with it, I\u2019m only 14 and it\u2019s all around me. It\u2019s in all the movies, ads, magazines, no wonder there are so many teen pregnancies. People just overdo it so much, and you can even watch it with porn movies. And we\u2019re all taught that it\u2019s wrong to have sex at a young age, yet all around us our movie stars are having it, and stars are idols to many people. It\u2019s hypocritical. You tell us not to but you do. We should stop publicizing sex, stop the porn, and focus on our lives and what we want to do and not what the world around us says is great. I guess this means I need a conclusion. Well, the conclusion is, this country needs to do some cleaning up. But we just started out we still have time. America has been around for a little more than 200 years. That\u2019s not a lot compared to the thousands of years that Christians claim this world to be, and its really not a lot compared to the billions of years old the scientists claim this world to be."}

Btw if you wanna know how to get your cisco routers on tacacs please go to :   urlLink http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/480/tacplus.shtml#intro   But the important part is how to break the current password :   Step 1 :  Attach a terminal or PC with terminal emulation to the console port of the router. Use the following terminal settings ( Generally Hyper terminal is used ) : 9600 baud rate No parity 8 data bits 1 stop bit No flow control   Step 2 :  Type   show version   and record the setting of the configuration register. Click here to see output of ashow version command. The configuration register setting is usually 0x2102 or 0x102.

Favorite song: Amy Hit the Atmosphere. Probably an odd pick, but theres something sorta haunting and sad about it. Okay...that description fits just about  every  song sung by Adam Duritz, but its especially true for this one. I like the repetition of And thats all that really matters to me. Such a great effect. Im slightly bummed that Im missing the Crows concert this July. Theyre playing in Columbia, MD (about 20 minutes away) and Brad and I planned on going. The tickets were a bit steep ($30), but Id be willing to fork it over to see my band. Oh, well...the assistantship couldnt be passed up, even if I couldve seen my band. :(  Still no tour dates for NY or PA, so who knows if Ill catch them this summer? I may have to resign myself to CDs."}

The tickets were a bit steep ($30), but Id be willing to fork it over to see my band. Oh, well...the assistantship couldnt be passed up, even if I couldve seen my band. :(  Still no tour dates for NY or PA, so who knows if Ill catch them this summer?

Not only did I wait in the rain for over an hour, but I did so after taking money out of a non-M&T ATM (thanks for the $2.75 service fee, plus M&Ts $1.25 charge). Oh, wait...but they didnt start their set at 7p. They didnt go on until 10p-ish. The opening band started sometime after 8p. I gave up by 7:30p and walked around the Harbor talking to Chris for the next hour-plus. Id just come off a 10.5 hour shift at work, all I wanted to see was Vertical, but that definitely didnt happen at the scheduled start time (and I was told by the concert promoters they were playing at 7p)."}

Once he was through, I opened the front door and looked up at the sun (as memories of Venus transit danced through his head) to see mountains of fire hurling down on the horizon. It was like that dream where Im running to get out of the way of the falling helicopter, but even though it crashes far away, it still rolls toward me and almost chops me up, except that I wake up. Anyway, I knew that the fire bombs were coming for me, and sure enough -- though they blasted a mountain on the horizon (apparently DC-Kansas isnt entirely flat) -- a huge wall of fire raced toward my home. My mom (who looked like Auntie Em from The Wizard of Oz) rushed me into the cellar and we hid under the stairs. I kept trying to coax Airick to hide under the stairs with us, but he stubbornly sat just out of reach, and I thought for sure hed get toasted. Thats when I awoke. urlLink   Im still waiting for my new checks. I ordered a Muppet set, complete with Kermit, Piggy, Animal, and Fozzie. When I received them, they contained Raggedy Anne and Andy.

In Search of the Beast   The symbol 666 has been misinterpreted and misused for millennia. I will now survey some of its most significant misuses. Many people, like Gary Blevins1, believe that the mark will be an invisible laser tattoo injected under the skin or a microchip that will be placed under the skin for scanning at the point of trade.

Therefore, since lasers and microchips were virtually unknown 2000 years ago, this \u201cinterpretation\u201d should be discarded. Other people like Blevins are literally obsessed with the number 666 and look for names that match them to identify the beast. Needless to say, such people can get stockpiles of names like the one Blevins2 mentions in his book, Ronald Wilson Reagan! It is interesting, though, that Ronald and Nancy Reagan are still haunted by this number. The Reagans retired to a house in 1989 at 666 St. Cloud Road, Beverly Hills.

Others do not count the letters of peoples\u2019 names to identify them with the beast but they look at their character, political affiliation and philosophy to see if they are the rightful owners of the mark, 666.

One may wonder why but the beast and his distinct mark\u2014666 became exotic and cool for many spiritually blind people who think the beast as a joke or a fabulous thing to be sought after! Here is one practical research that could shock the sensible:  \u201cA very informative Mark of the Beast spoof was recently staged on the Internet by Bill Cross. Bill wanted to try his hand at setting up a website. Bill decided for his first project, a spoof website of a company peddling the mark of the beast. So Global Monetary was created with the advertising Become an IDchip member and Receive $250!. Not wanting to cause real panic, Bill admittedly laced the site, with enough clues so that anyone who scrutinized it would know it wasnt for real and would therefore not panic. Bill was surprised, On the first full day of operation the site had more that 4,200 distinct user sessions averaging 6 minutes each. Emails began pouring in from hysterical Christians, privacy enthusiasts, the media world requesting interviews, and many who recognized it was simply a joke. Realizing things were getting out of hand, after just four days, Bill pulled the plug on Global Monetary. Bill also made this alarming statement, I realized that I was getting another kind of visitor to the site: People who actually wanted to receive the mark of the beast just to get in on the IPO. I was totally blind-sided by that. I never expected that to happen. . .16  How could one explain this unfortunate finding? The only explanation I know is that, out of ignorance, many people are playing with fire and they need serious help. It is time for the church to step up and save the na\u00efve. Many of these people are fascinated by the \u201cpower\u201d of the beast and their subtle dualism kicks in and that is why they give too much attention to the beast and admiration for his miracles. They are like the ones who shout \u201c\u201dWho is like the beast? Who can make war against him\u201d (13:4). I must be quick to mention that the beast has no power other than that he was temporarily given by God. John did not leave this unsaid; he says that the beast, like his lieutenant, is out there just to deceive. The beast\u2019s lieutenant, certainly another beast, (13:11) \u201chas two horns like a lamb\u201d, John writes. A horn was supposed to show authority, strength and power.

The mark of the beast is bogus mark fashioned after God\u2019s. God\u2019s mark is for protection\u2014even for disobedient  sinners like Cain: \u201c13 Cain said to the LORD , My punishment is more than I can bear. 14 Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me. 15 But the LORD said to him, Not so; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over. Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.\u201d Genesis 4. Ezekiel 9 also says: \u201c4 and said to him [the Lord], Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it. 5 As I listened, he said to the others, Follow him through the city and kill, without showing pity or compassion. 6 Slaughter old men, young men and maidens, women and children, but do not touch anyone who has the mark.

Sorry its been so long since Ive last dropped a post, time does fly! Anyway while Im enjoying my stay here in Puerto Rico I would like to get to the bottom of a  question I have. First of all the basketball team down here I am able to practice with until I know if I can play or not (long story but basically its all about needing residency and if I can slide with just coming to visit ever since I was little every yr or if I officially have to be here for a year to qualify to play) has been real cool. Talk about small world but I just happen to be playing with a girl who I was play against in college. Her along with one other girl both are from the states so immediately it was just natural to bond with them first. The one who I played against in college is real cool and pretty much goes with the flow like I do. The other player is coo as well a bit of a different style somewhat keeps to herself and sleeps a whole lot but she can be down to earth as well. For most of last week I was able to stay at their place a couple towns over since practice was right around the block from them. Eventually to complete the beginning stage of me getting to know them ..I had to find out the question every female athlete has to another when they meet someone......are you gay? Ha yes unfortunately for all us female athletes out there the sterotype for us being gay is definitely growing. I would say 1 out of every 4 women athletes are gay...however Wnba probably has a different ratio of probably 1 out of every 2 haha yup sounds about right! So to make a long story short one of my teammates I was staying with who I found out was gay convinced me and her other roommate who is straight to go to the club with her. My first response was hell ya I havent shaked my ass yet in Puerto Rico since Ive been here but then I put two and two together and realized it probably was a gay club...in the end I agreed I would go since the night we were going is open to everyone and plays really good music. So how was my experience to my first gay club......ummm I guess it was o.k. The first 40 minutes I had a blast since no one was really on the dance floor and  the three of us pretty much made our american mark with our style and dance moves..that was fun! As the time was ticking more and more people came on to the dancefloor..I would definitely say it was more gay men on the dance floor shaking their ass but there was still the hand full of girls dancing as well."}

Well maybe not but this is the first new update in a while. It all started after taking 3 of my 4 in car driving lessons with a real stickler named Norm. He sucked so I was really looking forward to driving with the \u201ccool\u201d guy named Steve. So Steve pulled up to my house and I got in the car at 5:00. I knew right away that this in car would not be like the others. Steve asked me what I listened to and then turned up the volume on 100.7 WMMS. As we pulled out of my apartment complex, Steve said, \u201cyeah, just go wherever you want, we\u2019ve got two hours to kill.\u201d  I was like ok whatever, turned left, and kept going strait down Ridge rd. for like 20 minutes. By this time Steve was getting bored and complaining about driving for 2 hours for no apparent reason so we turned left again onto Route 6 I think. After that we took the REALLY long way to Lakeland Community College where I had to do maneuverability. So I did the whole test twice and Steve was talking on the phone with Bruce the whole time. So after I do it twice perfectly Steve hangs up the phone and says, \u201cMan that Bruce is such a little chatterbox.\u201d  So he\u2019s like you don\u2018t have to do this thing anymore if you don\u2019t want to, your good enough to pass anyway. Then he says he wants to go over by a tree to have a smoke. I\u2019m thinking ok whatever he\u2019s gonna smoke and then we can go drive around some more and go home. Steve gets out of the car to have a smoke and he tells me I can drive around as long as I don\u2019t wreck the car. So I\u2019m driving around in this car when I only have my temps and Steve is standing there smoking. It would have been an awkward situation if I would have crashed in the Drivers ed car without a Drivers ed teacher in the car. I didn\u2019t crash though and I went back and picked Steve up. When I get him he\u2019s on his cell phone again and he\u2019s talking to someone and telling them that he had the best driver he\u2019s ever seen in the car. Well I\u2019d say he\u2018s in the top 3 and I can\u2019t even remember the other 2 is what he said. So after that we are pulling out of the parking lot and we see Norm pulling into the parking lot at the same time so Steve Honks the horn at them and yells HEY NORM. Less than a minute later Steve was honking at the campus cop and then we were on the road again. So by this time it\u2019s almost time to go pick up the next person who was driving after me and we go to the gas station to fill the tank up before we get on the freeway."}

By this time Steve was getting bored and complaining about driving for 2 hours for no apparent reason so we turned left again onto Route 6 I think. After that we took the REALLY long way to Lakeland Community College where I had to do maneuverability. So I did the whole test twice and Steve was talking on the phone with Bruce the whole time. So after I do it twice perfectly Steve hangs up the phone and says, \u201cMan that Bruce is such a little chatterbox.\u201d  So he\u2019s like you don\u2018t have to do this thing anymore if you don\u2019t want to, your good enough to pass anyway. Then he says he wants to go over by a tree to have a smoke. I\u2019m thinking ok whatever he\u2019s gonna smoke and then we can go drive around some more and go home. Steve gets out of the car to have a smoke and he tells me I can drive around as long as I don\u2019t wreck the car. So I\u2019m driving around in this car when I only have my temps and Steve is standing there smoking. It would have been an awkward situation if I would have crashed in the Drivers ed car without a Drivers ed teacher in the car. I didn\u2019t crash though and I went back and picked Steve up. When I get him he\u2019s on his cell phone again and he\u2019s talking to someone and telling them that he had the best driver he\u2019s ever seen in the car. Well I\u2019d say he\u2018s in the top 3 and I can\u2019t even remember the other 2 is what he said. So after that we are pulling out of the parking lot and we see Norm pulling into the parking lot at the same time so Steve Honks the horn at them and yells HEY NORM. Less than a minute later Steve was honking at the campus cop and then we were on the road again. So by this time it\u2019s almost time to go pick up the next person who was driving after me and we go to the gas station to fill the tank up before we get on the freeway."}

Steve gets out of the car to have a smoke and he tells me I can drive around as long as I don\u2019t wreck the car. So I\u2019m driving around in this car when I only have my temps and Steve is standing there smoking. It would have been an awkward situation if I would have crashed in the Drivers ed car without a Drivers ed teacher in the car. I didn\u2019t crash though and I went back and picked Steve up. When I get him he\u2019s on his cell phone again and he\u2019s talking to someone and telling them that he had the best driver he\u2019s ever seen in the car. Well I\u2019d say he\u2018s in the top 3 and I can\u2019t even remember the other 2 is what he said. So after that we are pulling out of the parking lot and we see Norm pulling into the parking lot at the same time so Steve Honks the horn at them and yells HEY NORM. Less than a minute later Steve was honking at the campus cop and then we were on the road again. So by this time it\u2019s almost time to go pick up the next person who was driving after me and we go to the gas station to fill the tank up before we get on the freeway. So Steve fills up the tank and asks me if I want anything from inside the gas station. I tell him I\u2019m fine but he brings out all kind of food anyway. So we get on the freeway to get back to Willowick from wherever we were and Steve hands me a doughnut. I\u2019m like ok whatever and keep driving when Steve cranks up the volume on the radio and tells me to go faster because people are passing us. So there I am driving down the freeway at like 70mph with one hand, eating a doughnut with the other hand in the drivers ed car with the stereo blasting WMMS, and passing all these cars on the freeway. As if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, I am eating this doughnut wrong and all the jelly comes dripping out the end of it and it\u2019s going all over the place. So now Steve is laughing and I\u2019m laughing and choking with this doughnut flying all over the car while still trying to drive down the freeway so Steve tells me I have to switch lanes to get off the freeway."}

So there I am driving down the freeway at like 70mph with one hand, eating a doughnut with the other hand in the drivers ed car with the stereo blasting WMMS, and passing all these cars on the freeway. As if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, I am eating this doughnut wrong and all the jelly comes dripping out the end of it and it\u2019s going all over the place. So now Steve is laughing and I\u2019m laughing and choking with this doughnut flying all over the car while still trying to drive down the freeway so Steve tells me I have to switch lanes to get off the freeway. I somehow get off the freeway and make it into another gas station to get all this jelly off of my shirt and my hands. I get back in the car and go to this girl\u2019s house to pick her up in the car. When she gets in the car she sits down and lets out a death shriek and Steve asks her if she saw a bug or what. It turns out that there was a bunch of jelly on the seatbelt and it looked like human blood. Apparently she was afraid she was dying or something, but anyway she gets in the car and starts to drive. While still on the back streets I find out that this girl has a fetish for subway and that she gets the same sandwich with a bunch of gay crap on it every time. She explained it in detail but all I can remember is that it had cheese, mustard, mayo, and chicken on the same bun. Scary if you ask me."}

Actually, it wasn\u2019t that bad, there was just a lot of stuff to pack. On the other hand, though, my mother told me that I could go through the boxes on the shelves against one of the walls and sort out what I wanted to keep. This was a good thing. This was a very good thing. Apparently both my mother and my aunt haven\u2019t been entirely on top of things, then again my grandparents had a lot of things they\u2019ve gotten over the years to sort through, and being the inquisitive person that I am (i.e. a professional snoop/researcher since I was four) I made a number of finds they missed. The first was a black faux fur coat that had been stuffed away. It looks like a cross between a wrinkled velvet blanket and a teddy-bear skin gone wrong but I liked it, must be my grandmother\u2019s side of me poking up. Come to think of it, if I was leaning that way in my thoughts, I would have said that the spirits of my grandmother and grandfather were guiding me in a way, or at least bludgeoning me because I\u2019m the only one in the family who apparently pays attention in a half-assed sort of way. You see, aside from the coat, I also found five boxes of L.P.s (yep, good old vinyl) of all kinds of music, although most were of a classical or operatic nature...which means they had to have been my grandmother\u2019s. Add to that, I found three boxes of sheet music and old books on music, and I do mean old! There are more than a few that will need to be re-bound, and one of them had the date of 1909. The above two things were important because music was very important to my grandmother. For most of her life she had been taking singing lessons and was very, very active in the music community here in St. Louis.

Note for those of you too young to know what \u201cfalsies\u201d are and those too old to remember...to sum up they were the old-timey version of the wonder-bra, only instead of it being a bra, it was just two pads that you stuck into your bra to lift, create cleavage, and make the breasts look a bit bigger. The second of these small anecdotes: the morning my grandmother died from her long fight with metastasized melanoma, barely able to speak clearly because of the second tumor in her brain, she sang \u201cLet Me Entertain You\u201d with all the energy she could."}

She was probably 1/2 joking, no a 1/4 joking, but the insinuation was still there and reminded me of the time she badgered me about a birthday present weeks and weeks before the actual event. I always felt compelled at the age of 13 - 18 to buy her expensive presents - I dont know why. Looking back she would have remained my friend either way. It baffles me to be honest. So this one time I actually started saving - which was hard as I didnt have an after school job, and I came from a single parent house hold with a parent who was paying for private education for two kids, paying a mortgage and still trying to provide the absolute best for her kids. But still I tried to save and with her birthday looming her badgering started to pick up, until a few days later I totally blew up. We were in class, Commerce Studies. She was asking me questions about what I had bought her. I still hadnt purchased anything. There was a silver ring I thought shed like, but the store didnt have lay-by and I hadnt saved enough. So after a million questions and me avoiding the questions - I blew up and told her off. I think I even threatended to hit her - thats how mad I was. I was asked to leave the room (That kind of behaviour is not tolerated in this school). Damage was done. We didnt speak and I never had to buy the present for her because of that."}

No, time marches on, of course, and nothing I can do--especially wishing--will change that. Also bitter to think that so many of the stupid mistakes our ancestors made are repeated on a daily basis, because we didnt study what came before us and thus cannot understand that these conflicts we keep fighting are not going to be resolved with a show of force and a taste of steel. The way I think about the future is maybe a bit odder, though even it is probably not unique to me. I am, as I said, a dream. I dream of what could be, of what will never be, of things real and imagined. I dream of the day when I become a professor in history, or even of the day an acceptance letter comes from one of the schools I applied to arrives in the mail. I dream of finding the right girl, of discovering we are right for each other, marrying, and living the cliched happily ever after that can only exist in a dream but never in reality, because everyone has to face a bumpy road. And I dream that maybe Ive already met her, that were just waiting for that right moment in time to realize that were meant for each other. Its hard to say. Funny thing is, I have a tough time acting in the present to enable me to realize my future, my dreams. I keep thinking itd be nice to be accepted to a great school for my PhD, but Ive been putting off filling out applications. I only finished off everything for another of them this afternoon, and it only took ten minutes to fill out the form, and a quick trip to the Post Office to send everything off. So why am I so hesitant, so lazy? Its not as though I was filling the rest of my time with excitement or important tasks that could only be done at that very moment. Why cant I connect the past, the present, and the future altogether into one tread of chronology, and recognize that things which were done then have an effect on now, and things done now have an effect later? Why are the three moments disconnected in my mind? The past is easy enough to understand. They say its like a foreign country, a distant land which no one can visit. Makes sense. But why do I have such a difficult time accepting the fact that the things I want to do later require activity now? I think its because Im a terrible planner, and I also expect things to just happen for me."}

I dont want to have to fill out applications to graduate schools without the assurance that Ill not only be accepted to the school, but Ill get a scholarship and Ill be able to get gainful employment upon graduation. Perhaps another example is in order--exercise. I hate to exercise, because I dont get immediate results. It takes a long time for any visible result to manifest itself. I mean, I run and run, and dont lose weight very quickly, if at all (though thats in part due to my eating habits, but thats another story). I know there are many long-term benefits to exercising, I just dont see any immediate ones. I hurt, I sweat, and Im not noticeably thinner at the end of the workout. So whats the bloody point? Its why I lose interest in things like that (or like playing the guitar, which Ive tried several times) so quickly--nothing tangible comes of it immediately, so why bother? As I said, this is a pretty big problem, and one I struggle with every moment of every day in some form or another. It could be that part of my problem is that Im the product of a society which places such emphasis and importance on instant gratification, on the fulfillment of base desires right now. But thats just a cop out, really. If Im truly interested in something, I should put forth the damn effort to achieve it, whether my effort is immediately rewarded or not. I have to be in this for the long haul, I have to make this moment mean something not only for now, but for later. I have to try, because dammit, whats the point in living for the moment if my moments on down the road are going to be empty, painful, and without purpose?"}

By now youve probably heard at least a little something about the Libertarian party.

We have candidates running for local and state level positions all across the country, and currently boast over 600 Libertarians in public office. Many people are even aware that the Libertarian party is the third-largest political party in American politics. In spite of all this familiarity, the one question that many people still seem to have is, ``What exactly is a Libertarian??`` People with conservative beliefs often see us as ``liberal`` because of our outspoken defense of personal freedoms -- like the freedom of expression, or the freedom for peaceful adults to decide what to eat and drink, and how to raise their children. On the other hand, people with liberal beliefs tend to see us as ``conservative`` because of our staunch defense of economic freedoms, including the freedom for people to trade with one another in a way that they decide is in their own best interest. These misconceptions say more about the prejudices of the people who hold them, than they do about the Libertarian perspective. Despite all the confusion, the Libertarian philosophy is especially easy to understand. Libertarians are, quite simply, people who believe in ``Self-Ownership``: I own myself, and nobody else on Earth has a higher claim to my body or my labor than I do. Likewise, we have a deep respect for other peoples` self-ownership: You own your body, and so long as youre acting in a way that doesnt interfere with anyone elses freedom, you should be free to do what you please. The idea of ``Self-Ownership`` is what is what distinguishes us from both liberals and conservatives. Every political position that Libertarians take can be traced back to this simple idea. For example, Libertarians are opposed to ``liberal`` attempts to use the government to regulate people`s buying practices by imposing tariffs on certain goods and industries. We oppose this kind of regulation not because we think that all goods and industries are equally wonderful, but because we believe that people own themselves, and can decide what to buy based on their own beliefs and values. If for some people that means buying fair-trade coffee at the local co-op grocery store, then thats great -- just as long as they don`t use the government`s power to force other people to do the same. Likewise, Libertarians are opposed to ``conservative``attempts to use the government to regulate peoples morality, by imposing laws that restrict their behavior on the Sabbath, or at the pharmacy, or in the bedroom. Were opposed to these kinds of legal restrictions not because we think that all lifestyle choices are equally worth pursuing, but because we believe that people own themselves, and can decide how to live their lives as they see fit."}
