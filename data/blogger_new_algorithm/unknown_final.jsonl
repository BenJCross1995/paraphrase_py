Thats way early, For the record, my vacation has been filled with days where Im getting up really early, which after a night of shooting/partying, is really fun, I must say. So we get over to AUC to meet with the students. We jump in three separate cars and head over to the outskirts of Heliopolis. The plan is really simple: we head to a meeting point where we will meet with Norhans dad, who will then lead the way over to the construction site. If only simple things could remain simple in Egypt. So we get to our meeting point to wait for Norhans dad. He gets there, and we begin to follow him. Four cars. Norhans dad is leading the way. Well, our driver (an AUC provided driver) decides to pass Norhans dad. Why? I have no idea. Another AUC driver does the same. Now, John and I are riding in the back seat, talking with Jan, who is riding up front. Were not really paying attention to whats going on  were assuming that our driver can do is prescribed job of following the car in front of him. So about 25 minutes later, the other AUC driver zips up next to us and flags us down, letting us know that weve passed the exit. (Mighty considerate of him, to do so  otherwise we might end up all the way in Sharm.) So we need to make a U-turn, which is not as simple as it seems because the highways in Egypt arent designed like they are back in the states. The next exit/U-turn is like 10 miles down the road. So we make the U-turn and come back to another exit about another 5 miles beyond the exit that we missed so we can make another U-turn. We do so, get off on the exit, and then stop. We dont see anybody. So we ask the other driver if he saw where everyone went. He didnt. He just saw the exit that he knew we were supposed to get off on, so he flagged us down. This led to about an hours worth of confusion. We call Norhan, who is with her dad, to see if she can give us directions. She cant, because she has no idea where we are. (Oh yeah, did I mention that streets in certain parts of Egypt dont have names? That makes it way easy to figure out where you are.) So we jumped back on the highway, looking for another exit. We literally drove back and forth (in 10 and 5 mile increments) making u-turn after u-turn, trying to get off on the right exit. So it turns out that after we passed everybody, they passed us again and kept going. So we never passed an exit where they had gotten off. We finally made it to the construction site about and hour later (after one of the girls jumped back on the highway, found us and led us back to the site.) Needless to say, Jan was less than pleased with this whole incident, but John and I (partially because of sleep deprivation) thought it was hysterical."}

I decided to type a few things that people in this world do that just make you want to shake your head...I would like to dedicate this website to that hungry fella on the trainthe other day(whose that? Just read) So I had to catch the train yet again the other day to go ball....getting on the train for me happens pretty often; I have seen some messed up people on the train so it takes a pretty strange person to actually catch me off guard. Anyways where I get on the train is the last stop on the orange line which means that their are many times when you are actually on the train and waiting for it to leave the station. This means that after you pay your token you have to go down what looks like a good hundreds of millions of stairs to reach the track without missing the train. To help you figure out what speed you need to attack the stairs to catch the train the good old train system rings this obnoxious bell to let you know the doors are about to close(I have yet to figure out exactly how much time you have after the bells rings..because I have definitely gotten left a few times..thats always a hard situation to play off ). I dont care who you are, anyone that has taken the train or even the bus before has felt cheap fighting between breaking a sweat running to your stop or just decided to wait for the next train or bus to come and get left. It is always the best satisfaction when you are in a rush and you catch that train/bus right before it is about to leave, however it is the worst feeling when you pick up your stroll or slight jog down the stairs just to be a step behind and watch all eyes on you as the train/bus passes you by (however you know Ive mastered how to play that off ..haha). I must admit their is a feeling of satisfaction when you are on the train looking at all the people who took their time thinking they were going to make the train and just miss by seconds....the face is pricelss and always gives me a little chuckle....except when people who are running after the bell has rung, who really dont get that hint (that you usually get once you hit that last flight of stairs from the track) that your ass is not going to make it and practically run right into the doors fighting for that last second ...I actually felt really bad for this poor lady who I saw booking down the stairs like her life depended on it and just when she was supposed to realize she was a step too slow ..well she didnt and ran right into the doors as they closed! If their was a sound affect that could best describe what her face did against the doors it would be S-M-O-O-S-H!It was an instance where you wanted to laugh but then feel really bad for her at the same time....Just makes me want to shake my head  So Im on the train, getting comfortable b/c I have several stops before I get off and this noise is irritating the hell out of me....I look diagonal from me and a grown man (late 20s early 30s) is straight tearing up this mango."}

The best part of this episode is where Homer shoots Flanders out of a canon and Flanders says as hes flying through the air,  I can see my house!. I dont know why but I laugh and laugh at that part. I remember being around the age of 8 or 9 and watching them at the cottage in South Hampton with my cousins and it was so much fun. I miss those days being a kid. I was talking with my cousin Natalie tonight and when we were younger we used to be so close and its unfortuante that weve drifted apart. I know were not alike anymore but her sister Angie I dont think are the same either but they get along great. Its a little weird how much Angie is like me when I was her age, but shes stuck with the lifestyle that I wanted and she suits it better then me. So on friday I was ready to quit and have a nervous break down. I went with Russell in the morning cause he worked at 7 and I didnt start work till 12, so I had a nap in the truck for awhile and then went to see Boo, the grizzly at 10:30. He was playing in his pool and he was so darn cute splashing around. He picked up a stick and put it in his mouth and was throwing it around while he was in the pool, he is just so darn cute I would love to hug him but hed probably rip my face off. So it was a busy day and there was 3 of us on and Eric the retail guy was no where to be found. He was up at the Eagle Eye restaurant supposively doing work but Mike our shipper and receiver was sayin that he was chatting with everyone up there and not doing work. So when I had to go over to retail and someone had asked where this certain size was I didnt know and it looks bad when the person that works at the resort doesnt know whats going on or what to do. So I was freaking out and Mel was helping me too, but she was kinda freaking out too. So I went downstairs to where Eric keeps some of his sizes and I tore the place up. Fuck him for leaving us the store and theres no way that Im going to put things back nicely after him leaving us alone! Right now hes probably loving this cause hes saving on labour cause hes so fucking lazy to hire someone! So later in the day Brenda left the cafeteria for us to look after and that was fine, but this huge group of English people wanted tea and ice cream so we were running around trying to help them and Justin the resort manager saw how we were panicking but he didnt do much to help out."}

Im supposed to be working right now, i feel really bad about that, i had to call in and tell them i had a little family obligation, brothers birthday and all, he seemed pretty let down. i hope he still wants me back on monday, i feel very tempremental at the moment. of course there is no family obligation, im just sitting in my room wishing i was out. i could easily go out right now, its only 6, sunday curfew is 9, i think. but im pretty sure ive got some homework to be doing. maybe ill go for a walk to the park on 20th and vermont. i used to go there when things were going badly. i remember one night in particular, it was about 10, or maybe later. i was withering away in my house, i was starting to realize things would never be the same, i only saw the bad in that, in change. so i put on my suede jacket with white cuffs, grabbed my phone and sketchbook, and went for a long walk to that park. i talked to casey for a long time, im pretty sure i was crying while i was talking. this whole event has partially faded in my mind now, it took me almost ten minutes just to remember why i was so upset that night. i do remember now, it was about kevie and kristin, swanky times. I always associate people with songs, i associate everything with songs. someone i new recently pointed this out to me. they always happened to start singing, or just mentioning songs i had particuarily strong feelings towards. like brown eyed girl the song by van morrison. my dad used to sing that to me all the time when i was little, i remember him with that song. Oh, not to go on another tangent, but once ive started thinking about something i go with it. there was another wong that i always associate with my dad. under the boardwalk i think its by the drifters but i cant quite remember. when i was little i had a loft in my room. it was really justa bunck bed without a bed on teh bottem. my dad built it for me when i was 4, it was a birthday present of sorts. anyway, i remember many nights, id lay up against the bars keeping me from rolling off and listen to me dad sing that song to get me to fall asleep (have i always had sleeping problems?) hed stand there, he was very tall. but was sparked the tangent was that one day i was with some friends of mine, we were waiting on line to go on a ferris wheel in golden gate park."}

I may be half crazy, but I loved it there. The drive to and from was so great that the bad cell phone reception didnt even bother me! This was one of the most peaceful weekends Ive had in ages. To start off, I got to Austin somewhat late Friday night. Of course, there was plenty of time in there to get lost...you know me! I planned to get good sleep Friday night, but I was visiting with a friend that I havent spent much time with in years, so this didnt work out as planned. I pop out of bed at 7:30 Saturday morning, change into my swimsuit and hit the road. Luckily I left a with a little extra time, because I got lost (once again) in my friends neighborhood. I love new cities. I find it extremely exciting to explore and find out all there is to see and all the wonderful stores to shop. My downfall is my horrible sense of direction. Youd think with my car having a compass built in that Id be fine...nope. Anyway, back to my morning. I finally find where Im supposed to be swimming, and Im right on time. I had no idea thered be so many women there. I would estimate 200-300 women were there for the practice swim. It could be more, as I tend to be an underestimator (not sure if thats an actual word). I walk up, sign in, blah blah blah. There was a time trial taking place just before my swim. The swimmers were supposed to finish in less than 12 minutes...theres no way! Thats some pretty fast swimming (for me atleast). When I first walked up, there were people holding three different signs to help and group us. Basically they were going to send us in waves of experienced, intermediate, and what the heck am I thinking groups. I put myself in the intermediate group. I wasnt terribly worried about my ability to swim, it was more the idea of swimming in the lake that had me scared. While they separated us into our group, we received a few transition tips, but nothing I hadnt already heard or read, although it was nice (and free). The experienced swimmers were sent out first...there were only a handful of women willing to jump into this category. Now it was time for me to strip down to my swimsuit and prepare for the water. Here I am standing in the middle of hundreds of women all in their swimsuits, ready to jump in. It was hard to be too scared because there were so many of us doing it. There were buoys set up all in the water for us to take breaks holding onto. We were told to swim to the first buoy, if we were tired take a break."}

We flew out of Des Moines at 5 on Friday,  and arrived in Seattle at about 11:00 their time which was 1am our time. Mary and I were really tired and the flight from Cincinatti to Seattle had been rough (we sat next to old people and old people + Turbulance = crying, screaming \u2026ie scary flight). Se we were tired and collecting our baggage, when my suitcase whizzed by me. Suddenly this guy comes up and grabs it for me. Then he comes over and asks if he can carry it for me too. We must\u2019ve had some strange looks on our faces because he chuckled and gathered me up in his arms in a bear hug and said, \u201cI\u2019m Joe, by the way, Libby\u2019s friend!\u201d Only then did Libby and her other friend Noel show up to validate his identity. They were extremely hyper and excited to see us, which was good because Mary\u2019s luggage was lost. Had they not been so happy, I don\u2019t think Mary would have taken it as well as she did. The ride to Libby\u2019s Apartment was awesome. They were singing songs and telling jokes the whole time and Mary and I forgot how tired we were. We dropped Joe and Noel off at the base, but not before the guards searched the whole vehicle AND my luggage because there were civilians in the car. Ugh! Ah well, security I guess. SATURDAY:             We met Andrew, Libby\u2019s roommate, bright and early in our pajamas. He works nights, so he was just getting home at 8:30 am. First off, he goes to the refrigerator and cracks open a Coors Light! I reacted from my gut \u201cUGH!\u201d before I could even check myself. I apologized because I didn\u2019t mean to be judgmental, but I had just woken up and a beer sounded like ass right then. So yeah, that\u2019s Andrew! The boy likes to talk\u2026more on him later. We knew we needed to get Mary some clothes because the jeans and T-shirt she had with her were not going to cut it for a night out on the town in Seattle, so we picked up Noel and the base and met Libby\u2019s friend Georgia at the hotel in Seattle. He then headed to the waterfront for some lunch at a seafood restaurant where they just dump the food out on the table in front of you. Not a seafood eater, I had a burger but enjoyed watching Mary, Libby, and Noel scarf down two buckets full of fish and seafood. Then we hit the shopping district and spent way too much money, and got stuck in some sort of parade on our way back to the hotel to get ready for our night out. We headed to Pioneer square to meet up with three guy friends from Libby\u2019s division: Mark, JD, and Asshole (can\u2019t remember his name\u2026but he was an asshole)."}

Well her house was lovely but I couldnt settle down and I think mum had thought that Id stay there with them for a week or so to get my head straight and to allow her some space but no sooner had I got there one day, I wanted to be away the next. Her Son Matthew made me nervous (a boy half my age) and I was even scared to interact with her daughter Charlotte who made me feel like a freak. I sat downstairs with Amanda and Mark (her husband) one evening, and we had a beer and watched football and had a curry and talked over things. I had a job to stop myself from crying and Amanda said that mum was just finding it difficult coping with me getting a boyfriend and that she was sure things would work out. She said shed phone mum in the morning to say I was okay and to talk to her, and so very very late indeed we all went to bed and I lay awake most of the night. I didnt sleep. There were things I could have done there. They had a kitten and the area was very pretty but I was just lonely and scared and I knew no-one. I was always twice as nervous as you Ben - even when I was double your age. Youve got so much more going for you than I had. Everythings going well for you and I really cross my fingers you never get ill like I did. If you dont nothing can stop you. I felt so nervous at Amandas that I couldnt stay so I told her I wanted to go home and she said okay shed take me to the station. Saul sent a text saying why didnt I go in the morning and hed meet me, wed go for lunch or something and then Id get the train home. So I met him and we went for something to eat and I came and saw his flat which was okay but was as all mens flats where they live alone are - it needed cleaning and redecorating. (least of my worries). We watched a bit of tv, I calmed down and then he took me to the station and I came home. I remember mum making an effort to make things better but I was so nervous. She cooked me my favourite meal which at the time was fried rice, and I didnt even eat it I felt so sick. It ticked along for a fortnight and then came the time when I had to decide whether I ever wanted to see Saul again, or whether I should just say sorry I couldnt. And Ive got no idea what would have happened if Id have said sorry no I couldnt, but at the time I was so scared that I needed a friend so losing him seemed unbearable."}

Although time goes in one direction, it is truly elastic, expanding&nbsp; to too much when it is not needed (say in a dentists chair, or worse, in a meeting), and contracting to too little when you really want it (when was that report due?). Time for me is a rubberband, and occasionaly it ricochets out of control off the floor, the ceiling, and the nearest human body (the cats have the common sense to get out of the way). To sum up in a hopefully painless way, work has kept me busy, my mother has kept me busy, and my cats have made it clear that the bed I sleep in is actually theirs, and that Im just borrowing space theyd rather not give up. Working at the YMCA has been enjoyable, interesting, and far from boring. Between phones, the computer, and checking in members while handing out towels, Im learning to multi-task like a five-ring circus with the occasional rampant lion or elephant. You see, if theres one thing Ive learned is that people on the whole, or at least those at the Y, are genrally good, patient, and if theyve got a problem or a complaint then they say so in a civil manner and thats that. Then theres the occasional lion-elephant, and even then those creatures are more docile than these&nbsp;two members whose tempers exploded this past week. Let me start by saying that at the front desk of the YMCA, the people who work there are pretty much the communication center of the building, but they are not the ones who make the decisions in regards to how the building and programs are run. That is for the administration to do, simple as that. So when theres a problem with the placement of the equipment in the fitness center, or some machine isnt working right, then we pass the information on to the appropriate person and they address those particular issues.&nbsp; Almost all the members at the Y seem to understand this, except for a couple, who if they do understand it, completly ignore it and rant like ill-mannered three-year-olds throwing a temper-tantrum because they cant get what they want. Interestingly enough, those ill-mannered three-year-olds throwing temper tantrums of late have been&nbsp;grown adult men, of which only one I have faced, and thankfully someone else was there to intercept him. Look, it is one thing to air ones grievences, to say that theres a problem and give suggestions as to how youd like it fixed, especially asking if there is a particular person you need to talk to about it.&nbsp;It is another thing to rant, rave, and attack people who arent even there, let alone a whole body of people. Its even worse when its done to people who have no control over the situation let alone any say. Just last Wednesday (and I was thankfully not there for this) a man came in at 6 p.m."}

It\u2019s now widely recognized that transformation is a pre-requisite to their survival and growth. Business organizations in India especially public enterprises are experiencing winds of change. For the HR function, there could not be a more existing and challenging opportunity than managing the complexities of change and transformation. HR today is playing a lead role along with business functions in creating the necessary momentum and internal capabilities. This project seeks to capture the value of \u201cSynergizing HRD Interventions for Growth\u201d covering the ideas and experiences like Changing Business Scenario and HRD Challenges, Organizational Transformation  and Restructuring, Managing Performance and Productivity Enhancement, Managing Diversity, Developing Learning and Training Capabilities and Aligning HRD to Business. HRD Interventions in Developing Global Competitiveness Today all are aware that it is the era of globalization and competitiveness. Right now the issue is not only of global competitiveness but local competitiveness. Till now, Indian industries have been so protected that it is not concerned about the emerging competition. These organizations today need to ask themselves where they are and where they need to go. Today\u2019s passwords should be competition for both survival and growth. To meet the new challenges, however, some of the organizations are planning well. As far as organizational planning is concerned Indian organizations are capable of planning well but regarding training and HRD interventions they are not performing too well and don\u2019t even give much importance to it. Normally everyone in the organization undergoes training. But to meet the emerging challenges and issues, organizations need to upgrade or modify their HRD interventions, or more specifically training interventions. NTPC is one of the few PSUs where attempts are being made to plan training interventions and a serious thought has been given it to make training a systematic method. Benchmarking HRD Practices Benchmarking is a method of establishing goals based on industry\u2019s best practices. It\u2019s appositive and proactive process change practices and procedures in a structured fashion to achieve superior performance. Today when there is competition not only within India but the world over, and when one can get all information about product, processes and all management styles in minimum time, there is a need to have better or even international benchmarks. Benchmarking HRD practices may help organizations to develop action plans better manpower planning and developing human resources in amore effective manner to meet the challenges of the new millennium. In order to make the kind of progress that is need to be competitive, HRD and quality professionals have to work in consonance with each other. It is one of the problems faced by many organizations. Why are things the way they are and what could be done to achieve a positive change? The 2 approaches to this problem have been followed since the early part of the century. One is the Human Resource approach, which promotes the ideas of freedom to act and freedom for creativity. The other is the Tailor\u2019s approach in terms of scientific management and in terms of standardization of method."}

I am not totally ashamed to admit this, because I dont think the lack of information is entirely my fault. We all know that our state is attacked everyday for our poor education and lack of jobs. While we usually fare better than dead last on most issues (thank God for Mississippi), our state can most often be spotted near the bottom of any number of rating lists. Looking beyond the general discourse of crooked politicians and decades under the leadership of one Uncle Eddie Edwards, which has led us down this rutted dirt road of poverty and ignorance, I think this years election reveals just how low we have all fallen. When I first realized my oversight, I was appalled. Here is an election for the highest official in state government and the only candidate Ive heard about is Jay Blossman! Im an educated individual who reads the news daily -- what must those who are less educated and informed be thinking right now? Since this time, I have spent several days voraciously searching the Times-Picayune Online for coverage of candidates for governor: who are they, what are their platforms, and what experience can they bring to the office? I derived this conclusion: I think Forest Gump, or rather the very creative writers of the screenplay, hit upon something: Stupid is as stupid does. The media coverage of this years election thus far has been atrocious! How can we, as Louisiana citizens, expect to improve our state when we cant even gain information about the important issues in our state -- mainly the governors election? How are we expected to make informed decisions for the better of our state if we only know the name of our choices? We are truly the blind being led by the blind, or the devious... Okay, I realize that the candidates just began qualifiying yesterday, but they have been campaigning before then. Theyve all launched websites and begun soliciting donations to their respective campaigns. They have all developed platforms with the changes they wish to make, but is this information readily accessible to the general public.... NO! Instead, our politicians literature is filled with the schools they went to and the affiliations they have. What is this, a race for SGA president or a governors election? Today I decided to search all the state newspaper websites until I found some nugget of info on our candidates platforms. I began with the Baton Rouge Advocate, assuming that because they were in the capital and closer to the action, they would indeed have extensive coverage. After all, its not like the Manships dont own or fund an entire university department, a newspaper, at least five radio stations and a television station; they are bound to have some sort of political connections (Yes, that was sarcasm). A blurb about a debate for the 2-year community college program and the earth shattering news that Hunt Downer was the first candidate to qualify yesterday was the only info I found (Damn, I cant seem to stop)."}

Breen  11/18/2002, Volume 008, Issue 10   Every Midget Has an Uncle Sam Costume  Writing for a Living  by Donald Bain  Barricade, 239 pp., $22.95   Murder at Fords Theatre  by Margaret Truman  Ballantine, 326 pp., $24.95   A BIZARRE PHENOMENON first observed in the 1940s became a crime-fiction epidemic by the 1990s. Famous entertainers, athletes, and presidential relatives began sitting down at the typewriter to bang out mystery novels. Or so they would have us believe. In truth, nearly every one of those celebrities made a deal through an agent or book packager, collected a nice advance for the use of the name, and left to a professional ghostwriter all the actual writing. Ghostwriting is a time-honored practice, and most readers surely realize that movie stars and baseball players have help with their memoirs--just as all politicians these days have help with their speeches, campaign literature, and policy statements. But the dissemination of novels that are ghostwritten seems somehow more blatantly deceptive and ethically questionable. Look, for example, at the new memoir by the veteran ghostwriter Donald Bain, who has written, under his name or others, some eighty books. In Every Midget Has an Uncle Sam Costume, Bain entertainingly describes his experiences as an officer in charge of censoring American Armed Forces Television in Saudi Arabia, as a jazz musician, and as an airline public-relations flack in a happier and more free-wheeling era of air travel. But the most intriguing topic in the book is ghostwriting. Bains first major success, Coffee, Tea, or Me? (1967), presented the comical amatory adventures of two stewardesses who appeared in public as the authors, Trudy Baker and Rachel Jones. Three sequels followed, plus similar faux first-person accounts of nurses, office temps, teachers, and actresses, always with attractive young women recruited to front the books for publicity purposes. Bain also wrote the autobiography of actress Veronica Lake, crime fiction signed by the actor David Toma and the ex-cops Nick Vasile and Mike Lundy, and the Murder, She Wrote novels in ostensible collaboration with Jessica Fletcher, the fictional character played on television by Angela Lansbury. Theres no doubt that readers can be extraordinarily naive. About the cover photos on the Murder, She Wrote books, Bain reports, one fan wrote in to say it was amazing how much Angela Lansbury looked like Jessica Fletcher. But when the ostensible author is a real person--and the book itself is a novel--readers dont seem unreasonable in expecting that the person whose name appears on the cover actually wrote the book. Employing a ghostwriter on a work of fiction is never more dubious than when the putative author really is a writer. Brett Halliday (creator of Mike Shayne), Leslie Charteris (creator of the Saint), and Ernest Tidyman (creator of Shaft) all turned to ghosts to carry on the exploits of their famous characters. The Ellery Queen team employed other writers to turn out paperbacks that were very different from the genuine Queen novels."}

The karate day classes are funny; sometimes therell be heaps of people and like yesterday, there was 3 of us. Not that small classes are a bad thing, but I find they lack the energy of a big group. It also makes it hard for the instructor to conduct a lively class with so few students (in my experience at least). It sure was in stark contrast to the group of 42 girls from Sydney Girls who came in after our class!
