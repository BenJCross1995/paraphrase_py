My trip to Egypt has solidified my belief that first and foremost, I am a filmmaker. I dont think there is anything that I enjoy as much as the filmmaking process.   Although the Egypt production was pretty low budget, I could totally see myself doing a combination of ethnographic/social documentaries as well as fictional narrative films. I think that one part could finance the other. Now I just need to find a way to finance film projects on a continuous basis. Going the academic route is certainly one possibility. There is something to be said about being in school for 9 months and then applying for a grant to shoot for another three months. I would just need to find an academic program that would allow me to combine the two. Im not much of a cultural anthropology guy, but if thats what it takes, I may go that route. The other route would be to concentrate on one comparative area (say the Middle East or Latin America) and enroll in an academic program that focuses on a variety of socio-political and economic issues from the said area, and then apply for grants to shoot films in that area. I suppose that another academic route would be to go for the MBA, specialize in entrepreneurship, and use that academic foundation to open up a production company that combines the academic documentaries along with narrative fictional projects. Thats the strongest possibility right now. I need to start writing to admissions officers to see how I could structure such a program.  Another thing about going back to school is that it would certainly allow me to take off to Europe for a summer and take some courses. I really really love Madrid; I think its absolutely great. I could totally do Barcelona or Salamanca for a summer semester and then head out to other European cities on weekends and breaks. On that note, perhaps I should consider London School of Economics. Thatd be a quick way to get to Europe and do the academic thing at the same time. Hmmmmmm.   Need to see how this is all going to work. So many thoughts running through my head, but for the first time in a long while, I am beginning to see a semblance of the path that I need to take in order to make it all happen. Weird  as Im writing this, my iPod is playing a song by JET called Move On. First few lines  Well I been thinkin bout the future / too young to pretend / its such a waste to always look behind you / you should be lookin straight ahead. Yeah, Im going to have to move on / before we meet again.  -  Mia, your music taste rocks.   MBA  production company  documentaries  film projects  creative projects  photography  graphic design. I think my resources (in terms of networking, personnel and personal skills) are at a point where I can make it happen. Just need some venture capital. Make your checks out to Rhinohazard Productions, please. : )   I love the fact that its 9:30 PM over here and still daylight. Been here at this caf? for about an hour, and (partially because of the two espressos that Ive had) I am really enjoying life right now. Its going to be really difficult to get back into the swing of things back home mainly because shooting this film has really made me aware of everything that Im missing out on in life. So many people, so many places, so many projects designed to discover. I know Ive said this before, but this has really been a life-changing project. I think I need to take more time to discover peoples and their societies, starting back home in Miami. I need to do more photography projects, I need to shoot more fun creative projects, and I need to write more. This is just a start, but I can say (and its not the caffeine speaking, I swear) that Im on an incredible natural high right now. I just feel like smiling. Life is really good right now, and I just want to make this feeling last. I think editing this doc will help me sustain it for a few months. But I need to travel again, and soon - possibly a December return to Egypt with my dad and my brother to do some more scuba diving in Sharm and perhaps a return to Cairo and the pyramids. I might also do some more touristy stuff like the museums and such.  I think I might also take an Arabic class. I got to a point in my time in Cairo where I felt comfortable listening to the language  I could recognize words (not necessarily their meanings) spoken in conversation. Reading and writing Arabic are a whole other world  but maybe I could learn. Might come in handy some day. I was able to pick up enough conversational Arabic to take a cab back home. Another fun project. I think if I infuse enough caffeine into my system when I get back home Ill be able to sustain my energy for all these projects. But its so difficult when naps are soooo tempting. Must fight off the urge  at lease for the next three months. Lifes challenges are so hard.  Another thought. I guess one of the unforeseen personal benefits from this trip has been this: In conducting several interviews with each of our subjects over the course of two weeks to arrive at an articulation of their perceptions of their identity and their society, Ive been able to reflect on my own identity and articulate my own thoughts on some of the issues theyve addressed. In addition, Ive been able to branch off from their ideas and construct an interpretation of how I view myself and the society I live in. This to me is the greatest aspect of documentary filmmaking  that in the process of telling the stories of individuals and their societies, I absorb their stories (and the process of recording them) into my own personal history. So vs a vs the documentary process, I continuously reflect on my own identity and further define who I am as an individual. I cant think of any other way to learn about other people and their cultural nuances and still retain part of their stories as part of your own.            "}

No, not of the master kind, Paul.  I was Debate Club President in high school.  Beyond that, I just like to argue anything with anyone, but I'm sure most of you DO know that.  I have a tendency to play 'devil's advocate' more often than not, just because I find it stimulating, trying to logically make a claim for one stance or another.  I get myself in lots of trouble with my husband, because he always assumes that I am trying to tell him that he's wrong... which isn't necessarily true, at least not a majority of the time.  I just like arguing!  It's hereditary; you should see my brother and I go at it.  Over the past few weeks, months even, I've been boiling to spout out some good rants on US politics in general.  I think I've done a fairly good job of containing my diatribe.  Besides in a courtroom, I doubt anyone sees more argumentation or rhetoric than a politician.  Have you listened to these people lately?  On one side we have the 'jackass' democrats (AKA: Poor, suffering whiners) who are in this almost comical attack mode as of late against the arch-enemy, the never forgetful 'elephant' Republican Party (AKA: Five-year-old elitests).  Each side has attempted to make appealing arguments on all variety of issues, from important to the mundane.  What have I heard?  Nothing but logical fallacies.  Let's use the War on Iraq as our example today.  First the democrats have a point, albeit a weak one.  The current 'Republican' generic justification for the war is what is called an  Ad hoc  logical fallacy, which literally means 'after the fact.'  Remember the story: 'we were going to Iraq to protect our country from WMD, but since we haven't found WMD the war is still justified because Saddam was an ass.' Yeah, Saddam was an ass when we started the whole affair, and his internal legitimacy as a leader was certainly questionable and more than enough reason to wage an offensive war.  In other words, whomever decided to argue for this war in the first place made the mistake of using the wrong evidence.  Tell me if I'm wrong, but aren't we taught from grade school up to verify the validity of our evidence (facts, research, whatever you want to call it)?  I digress.  So a few people made a big 'boo-boo' from inside the Bush administration; and, whether they were the culprit or not, someone has taken the blame for the mistake... kind of.  Should be the end of it right?  But of course not, this is America after all.  Nope, we instead get blessed with mounds and mounds of whining which have simply boiled down to  Argumentaum ad hominem  -- argument against man.  'Mr. XYZ and his colleague Mr. DCB aren't to blame for this mess, the entire Republican party is to blame because they are a bunch of idiots, just like their idiot Texas president.'  Sound familiar?  This is pretty much the rhetoric of the 'debates' between the Democratic primary candidates.  Who can make the better sounding attack.  *rolling my eyes*   And the freakin' 'Republican leadership' doesn't get much better with their  Tu quoque  retorts.  To quote Pee-Wee Herman, 'I know you are, but what am I?'  Since when did we all revert back to Kindergarten?  In Kindergarten, none of us were expected to plead a case based on factual evidence.  We weren't expected to create intricate arguments designed to sway the listener to one way of thinking.  Nope, not until college do some people even remotely experience a full-fledged lesson in how to write an argumentative essay.  This is the point when we start learning about logical fallacies, arguments that might sound good but are ultimately arrived at through false means.  This is where we are SUPPOSE to learn that 'because I said so' just isn't a good enough argument response.  Unfortunately, we adults can't seem to get over what appears to be our trained 'stupid' responses.  And you know, we've all fallen for it: hook, line and sinker.  Yep, we've now succumbed to making these broad generalizations about people solely based on whether they vote Democrat or Republican.  We all attack each other, blaming the other for what's wrong with the world, the environment, and the Cox cable internet that never seems to work right.  The letter R or D now speaks for us; we don't even have to open our mouth before the words are put in by someone else.  In an ideal world, I guess that could be kind of interesting:  never having to think for ourselves because we are too busy thinking solely for someone else.  Hey, I know some people who could definitely benefit from that!  Unfortunately, I can't stand playing that game.  I have too much fun thinking to allow someone else to do it for me!  Quite honestly, I'm tired of the stupidity that has been chosen to represent me.  Excuse my language, but FUCK the Ivy League educations and FUCK the millions of bucks they've made.  Stupid is as stupid does, as Forrest Gump said.  Sure, you might have two degrees from Yale and 2 mil. in the bank, but if you sound like an idiot, you will be perceived as an idiot.  Quite honestly, I'm embarrassed for the whole lot because they sound down right dumb!  You think some fancy, Armani suited politician had anything, ANYTHING to do with finding Saddam over the weekend?  Other than sending the troops over in the first place, absolutely nada!  Could you just imagine what this whole 'war' would look like if we sent the politicians over to fight and left the soldiers in the homeland?  Yep, I'm chortling at the ridiculous picture myself.  But alas, on the ole homeland we are in a war of words.  Great, so we've decided rhetoric is the weapon of choice between the donkeys and the elephants.  Perhaps now would be a good time to learn how to use our words properly, nes pas?  What we all need is a bare bones basic lesson in argumentation.  We need to learn how to argue a good point (RE: arguing which political party was responsible for Saddam is what's called a bad point) AND still get our shit accomplished.  We definitely need to learn to realize fallacies in our rhetoric.  We all need to make sure that when we back up a claim, we aren't doing it with thin air!  Ignorance cannot be an excuse anymore.  After that, I'd say we probably need a new political party up in here: the Republican leadership is too conservative for me, but the Democratic leadership is way too liberal.  So what are we gonna do about it?         "}

Well maybe not but this is the first new update in a while.  It all started after taking 3 of my 4 in car driving lessons with a real stickler named Norm.  He sucked so I was really looking forward to driving with the \u201ccool\u201d guy named Steve.  So Steve pulled up to my house and I got in the car at 5:00.   I knew right away that this in car would not be like the others.  Steve asked me what I listened to and then turned up the volume on 100.7 WMMS.  As we pulled out of my apartment complex, Steve said, \u201cyeah, just go wherever you want, we\u2019ve got two hours to kill.\u201d  I was like ok whatever, turned left, and kept going strait down Ridge rd. for like 20 minutes.  By this time Steve was getting bored and complaining about driving for 2 hours for no apparent reason so we turned left again onto Route 6 I think.  After that we took the REALLY long way to Lakeland Community College where I had to do maneuverability.  So I did the whole test twice and Steve was talking on the phone with Bruce the whole time.  So after I do it twice perfectly Steve hangs up the phone and says, \u201cMan that Bruce is such a little chatterbox.\u201d  So he\u2019s like you don\u2018t have to do this thing anymore if you don\u2019t want to, your good enough to pass anyway.   Then he says he wants to go over by a tree to have a smoke.  I\u2019m thinking ok whatever he\u2019s gonna smoke and then we can go drive around some more and go home.  Steve gets out of the car to have a smoke and he tells me I can drive around as long as I don\u2019t wreck the car.  So I\u2019m driving around in this car when I only have my temps and Steve is standing there smoking.  It would have been an awkward situation if I would have crashed in the Drivers ed car without a Drivers ed teacher in the car.  I didn\u2019t crash though and I went back and picked Steve up.  When I get him he\u2019s on his cell phone again and he\u2019s talking to someone and telling them that he had the best driver he\u2019s ever seen in the car.  Well I\u2019d say he\u2018s in the top 3 and I can\u2019t even remember the other 2 is what he said.  So after that we are pulling out of the parking lot and we see Norm pulling into the parking lot at the same time so Steve Honks the horn at them and yells HEY NORM.  Less than a minute later Steve was honking at the campus cop and then we were on the road again.  So by this time it\u2019s almost time to go pick up the next person who was driving after me and we go to the gas station to fill the tank up before we get on the freeway.  So Steve fills up the tank and asks me if I want anything from inside the gas station.  I tell him I\u2019m fine but he brings out all kind of food anyway.  So we get on the freeway to get back to Willowick from wherever we were and Steve hands me a doughnut.  I\u2019m like ok whatever and keep driving when Steve cranks up the volume on the radio and tells me to go faster because people are passing us.   So there I am driving down the freeway at like 70mph with one hand, eating a doughnut with the other hand in the drivers ed car with the stereo blasting WMMS, and passing all these cars on the freeway.  As if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, I am eating this doughnut wrong and all the jelly comes dripping out the end of it and it\u2019s going all over the place.  So now Steve is laughing and I\u2019m laughing and choking with this doughnut flying all over the car while still trying to drive down the freeway so Steve tells me I have to switch lanes to get off the freeway.  I somehow get off the freeway and make it into another gas station to get all this jelly off of my shirt and my hands.  I get back in the car and go to this girl\u2019s house to pick her up in the car.  When she gets in the car she sits down and lets out a death shriek and Steve asks her if she saw a bug or what.  It turns out that there was a bunch of jelly on the seatbelt and it looked like human blood.  Apparently she was afraid she was dying or something, but anyway she gets in the car and starts to drive.  While still on the back streets I find out that this girl has a fetish for subway and that she gets the same sandwich with a bunch of gay crap on it every time.  She explained it in detail but all I can remember is that it had cheese, mustard, mayo, and chicken on the same bun.  Scary if you ask me.  We got onto the main roads and she kept giving me whiplash on the starts and stops.  Then we were stopped at a light with some guy in a pickup truck sitting next to us and Steve tells this girl that she should look this guy in the eye and nod so he will know that it is time to race.  Of course she does it and when the light turns green she slams on the gas pedal.  The speed limit was 50 on that road but we were soon going way faster than that.  When Steve asked her if she wanted to slow down she said \u201cYou can\u2019t get a ticket in the driver\u2019s ed car, can you??\u201d Of course you can so we slowed down and stopped at a red light about an inch behind the car in front of us.  Finally we pull up to my apartment and I get out while Steve is making fun of that chick for liking high school football.  I was left dazed and confused but it was awesome and would do it again if I could.    And now because this site is based off of making fun of Simmons or copying off of his website I give you the quote of the week.  \u201cYou can\u2019t get a ticket in the driver\u2019s ed car, can you??\u201d   ~chick who was driving after I did                "}
{"id": 357508, "author_id": 2534568, "gender": "male", "age": 17, "topic": "Education", "sign": "Leo", "date": "09,June,2004", "text": "       Normally, when someone sees a problem in a system, they recognize it and rid the system of the problem. But what happens when a person finds a problem within themselves? When they\u2019ve finally gone through the agony of looking back at themselves and discover a problem, what do they do? I guess it would depend on the problem, and the person. For example, if someone were to figure out that they have a drug addiction then they might commit themselves to a rehab center, but if another person were to discover that they were compulsive liars, they might just continue on with their issues, possibly feeling guilty, but nonetheless continuing.   Reason I bring it up is because I have my own problems, and I full well acknowledge them, but I haven\u2019t changed every one of them. I used to have problems with abusing the internet for various reasons and I changed my ways, finally growing up and seeing that what I was doing was wrong and immoral. So in that instance I\u2019ve changed. But in others, with a lot of my other problems such as: not speaking up, holding back emotions, not watching my words (such as \u201cwhatever\u201d), and there are more I may touch on later.   With the first, not speaking up, I have a strange dilemma with, well, it may not be strange but it is a dilemma either way. So far, it has not put a huge dent on my life, there have been times where if I had spoken up I may have succeeded in something I otherwise took the back seat in, or it just plain would have been better had I said something, or said it louder. There was one situation where I could have missed out on the love of my life, but due to the incredible friends I have been so graciously gifted with, all was not lost and I get to share my heart with the most incredible person in the world, something I thought might not ever happen. But other than the prior mention issues, I have not had huge consequences on my inability to speak up, therefore I have not tried to change it. Lately though I have been coming to the grave realization that if this does not change I will not be able to move into adult life correctly. I can run a business, and have it be the most successful one in the world, I\u2019ve somewhat proven that in my journalism work, but the problem is getting there. In school, you can become acknowledged in basically one of two ways, through being loud about yourself, or by being recognized for diligence. My situation is the latter, I got where I am through what I have done, and it should work that way throughout the world, but unfortunately it does not. In the real world I have to network, talk to the right people, make the right connections, or else I\u2019m going no where. If I can\u2019t make contacts and just rely on my workmanship, I won\u2019t get where I want to be. Sure people would recognize me for being a workhorse, but I\u2019ll still be sitting at the bottom. Speaking up and voicing what I see and think along with my track record of good work is what will put me on top, I just have to learn to do it. I\u2019m trying desperately to grow up and overcome this issue, and only time will tell whether or not I am able to face the change.  With the second problem, holding back emotions, it\u2019s been more urgent to overcome, but I have pretty much done so. There is a \u2018but\u2019 though, I have only been able to do it because of the person I\u2019m in love with. I\u2019ve always felt like I was sensitive, but I haven\u2019t always shown it. Recently I have become more upfront about what it is I\u2019m feeling, in some ways anyway, I can honestly say that I whole heartedly try not to hold back what it is I\u2019m feeling when someone asks if there is something wrong with me. Sometimes though I still keep it to myself, maybe because it is for the better, or the situation isn\u2019t right for expelling emotions, or I\u2019m just being stoic. It\u2019s not always good for me to hold back though, because it hurts others that might want to help and creates a whole other problem worse than what you started out with. I\u2019m still unsure of what exactly I should do with this situation, but all I know is that I want to be more open and I\u2019m trying to do so every new day.  When it comes to watching my words, I need to do just that, watch them. Far too many times for my taste have I blurted out a \u2018whatever\u2019 when I completely did not mean to. I try to make use of an extensive vocabulary, but when I get tired it all just goes down hill. Especially when I\u2019m full up on emotions, I don\u2019t care what words I use, I just use them and only I know what I am saying, leaving the rest of the world out there hanging trying to figure out what it is I meant. And it usually turns out in ways I never meant it to. It\u2019s something I continue to work on, I\u2019m better than I used to be, but not perfect.  So being a human being myself, I would guess that everyone else goes through the same process. You see a problem, see where it has hurt you, or where it hasn\u2019t, and form that point you decide whether, subconsciously or otherwise, that you\u2019re going to either change or leave yourself be. It would be easier if we could all just treat ourselves like a system and get rid of whatever problem we have, but as humans it is more difficult because we complicate the issues; it\u2019s too hard for us to accept such sudden change. Point is we can change, it is in our nature, we just have to be able to acknowledge our problems and tackle them head on.   **By writing this I am in no way asserting that I know something you all do not, I am simply going through a thought process and putting it in writing so that I may be able to look back on it and gather new knowledge from seeing my thoughts laid out in print form. My reasoning for posting this is that it takes a bit of a deeper look at myself than my other writing normally does, so therefore it ends up on Logos & Amor rather than elsewhere.           "}

Thursday - Had a training session with Shihan and Michelle (who's also going to NZ) and it was a complete change from the day before, had lots of 'zip' and my technique was a lot better, especially on my front kicks. Shihan and I did a run down to the chemist to pick up some supplements to help with my energy levels and the healing process.   Friday - Didn't do as well as on Thursday but training was quite different, lots of basics and little sparring. While on as physically demanding, it still is challenging fitness wise, actually I dare say even more so! Oh yea, and Shihan kicked me in the privates while demonstrating a technique. He didn't get me in the jewels, which usually makes you feel sick; instead, he got me on the top of my member and suddenly had this burning sensation I never quite felt there before. (I didn't feel any pain I guess I was in shock!) Thoughts rushed into my head like, 'I'm bleeding! MEDIC!!!' But yea my gi didn't turn red or anything, so it was all good. It was scary for like a minute or so while waiting for the burning to subside!  After training Shihan and I went over to Chris' place for dinner - he's a close friend of Shihan's and also trains with us at the dojo. His mom was over so she cooked a big meal (typical greek, cooked for 3 but enough to feed 5-6 people!) and we watched a DVD after. It was 12am by the time we left so I crashed at Shihan's for the night.   Saturday - Had a bit of a lazy morning, Chris came over to fix a leaky pipe in Shihan's bathroom and we sat around and chatted for a bit. I headed off about lunchtime back to Penrith and rested in the afternoon before going to Mey's bday thing at Darling Harbour. Made my way down to the city and took me ages to find parking, which redeemed public transport for me once again (despite its crapiness).  I finally met Alan (as in fellow Bruneian, Alan) and despite what Mey and Sheryl seem to think, I don't see any sort of resemblance or qualities about him that mirror or resemble me in any way. Oh well, I did only just meet him so I guess I should reserve any final observations for now.  The Shelbourne was... um, interesting I guess. The DJs weren't much good and it wasn't just my opinion from observing the looks of bewilderment on the faces of people on the dance floor as the RnB DJ transitioned from song to song. The retro DJ didn't fare much better, he wasn't even transitioning between songs. He was also greatly annoying me with his overuse of the technique of pulling down the music to let the crowd sing along. It works well when used on a song where the crowd's really hyped - but even then not on every chorus! *place murderous thoughts here* I guess the only saving grace the Shelbourne had was that it had cheap entry and it's a hotel, not a dedicated club. But still...  Yes I'm really pedantic about music and how it's delivered - especially since I've organised dance parties and stuff before (and once upon a time live sound was my living). Did I mention the music was loud to the point where it was DANGEROUSLY loud? (I saw all the statistics flash in front of my eyes - max duration of exposure at 'x'dBs, 'x' hours.) I forgot my proplugs (special purpose earplugs) too, dammit.   Sunday - Basically sat on my ass the whole day, didn't help that I had a cold and felt like crap, must have been all the smoke from the night before. At least I managed to get a decent sleep for once.   Monday - Went to SAE (the college I graduated from) to pick up my degree certificate and as I was entering the front door, Lana (the so-hot receptionist) spotted me while coming back from her lunch break and called out my name. Now that's really funny because as I was walking in, I saw that she wasn't at the desk and I was thinking, 'Aw, she's not around!' :P  Anyways, she graciously escorted me to the building adjacent to show me where Rene's (my ex-lecturer)temporary office is due to renovations. They're expanding the college and they've incorporated CGC (Computer Graphics College) into the building since buying it over last year. A shame really, because CGC had a great facility on William Street just 10 mins walk away. (SAE is just shit by comparison.)  While waiting for Rene to be done with another student, Veit, one of my ex-classmates walks in and we did a bit of catching up and he went into a long bitch about the state of the audio industry in Australia and how there is basically no work. (I feel better now for working in IT because I know I'm definitely not missing out.) I collected my certificate shortly after and all I can say about it is... I'm not sure what to say really! It's perhaps the most sorry looking degree certificate I've ever seen, my Certificate IV one looks more impressive. Oh well, it is just a piece of paper after all, but what a sad one it is - SAE, you've outdone yourself this time.  Onto training in the evening, and tonight I felt good. I was holding the big pad for John and usually he hurts me through it, but tonight I stood my ground and I even flustered him during the last round by hassling him constantly. He likes to keep his distance because of his reach advantage and I wasn't giving him any room... and boy, it felt good to be able to stand up to the stuff he puts out. :)  I still have a ways to go in other areas, but that one small thing made my night. Shihan was happy with it too, said I even had that 'dead look in my eyes' or expressionless face that you strive to have. Reason for it is not to show your opponent anything and it sure as hell works. Hitting someone with everything you have and seeing them not even flinch sure takes the fighting spirit out of even the best of fighters.  Time to ice those legs and get to bed.             "}

Corollary An equiangular triangle is also equilateral.  4-3 (AAS Theorem) if two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding parts of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.  4-4 (HL Theorem) if the hypotenuse and a leg of one right triangles are congruent to the corresponding part of another right triangle, then the triangles are congruent.  4-5 if a point lies on the perpendicular bisector of a bisector of a segment, then the point is equidistant for the endpoints of the segment.  4-6 if a point is equidistant from the endpoints of a segments, then the point lies on the perpendicular bisector of the angle.  4-7 if a point lies on the bisector of an angles, then the point is equidistant from the sides of the angle.  4-8 if a point is equidistant from the sides of an angle, then the point lies on the bisector if the angle.  5-1 Opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent 5-2 Opposite angles of a parallelogram are congruent 5-3 Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other 5-4 If both pairs of opposite sides of a quadrilateral are congruent, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram 5-5 If one pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral are both congruent and parallel, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. 5-6 If both pairs of opposite angles of a quadrilateral are congruent, them the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. 5-7 If the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram 5-8 If two lines are parallel, the all points on one line are equidistant for the other line. 5-9 If three parallel lines cut off congruent segments on one transversal, then they cut off congruent segments on every transversal. 5-10 A line that contains the midpoint of one side of a triangle and is parallel to another side passes through the midpoint of the third side. 5-11 The segment that joins the midpoints of two sides of a triangle (1) is parallel to the third side. (2) Is half as long as the third side. 5-12 the diagonals of a rectangle are congruent 5-13 he diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular 5-14 Each diagonal of a rhombus bisects two angles of the rhombus. 5-15 The midpoint of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equidistant from the three vertices. 5-16 Is an angle of a parallelogram is a right angle, then the parallelogram is a rectangle 5-17 If two consecutive sides of a parallelogram are congruent, then the parallelogram is a rhombus. 5-18 Base angles of an isosceles trapezoid are congruent 5-19 The median of a trapezoid (1) is parallel to the trapezoid (2) has a length equal to the average of the lengths.  6-1 (the exterior Angle Inequality Theorem) the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is greater that the measure of either remote interior angle  6-2 if one side of a triangle is longer that the second side, then the angle opposite the first side is larger than the angle opposite the second side. 6-3 if one angle of a triangle is larger than a second angle, then the side opposite the first angle is longer than the side opposite the second angle. Corollary 1 the perpendicular segment from a point to a line is the shortest segment from the pinto the line Corollary 2 the perpendicular segment from a point to a plane is the shortest segment from the point to the plane 6-4 (the triangle inequality) the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side. 6-5 (SAS Inequality Theorem) if two sides of one triangle are congruent to two sides of another triangle, but the included angle of the first triangle is larger than the included angle of the second, then the third side of the first triangle is longer than the side of the second triangle. 6-6 (SSS Inequality Theorem) if two sides of one triangle are congruent to two sides of another triangle, but the third side of the first triangle is longer that the third side of the second, then the included angle of the first triangle is larger than the included angle of the second.  7-1 (SAS Similarity Theorem) if an angle of one triangle is congruent to an angle of another triangle and the sides including those angles are in proportion, then the triangles are similar. 7-2 (SSS Similarity Theorem) if the sides of two triangles are in proportion, then the triangles are similar. 7-3 (triangle Proportionality theorem) if a lone parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally. Corollary if three parallel lines intersect two transversals, then they devide the transversals proportionally 7-4 (Triangle Angle-Bisector Theorem) if a ray bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divided thw opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides.  8-1 if the altitude is drawn to the hypotenuse of a right triangle, then the two triangles formed are similar to the original triangle and to each other. Corollary 1 When the altitude is drawn to the hypotenuse of a right triangle, the length of the altitude is the geometric mean between the  segments of the hypotenuse. Corollary 2 when the altitude is drawn to the hypotenuse of a right triangle, each leg is the geometric mean between the hypotenuse and the segment of the hypotenuse that is adjacent to that leg. 8-2 (Pythagorean Theorem) In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs. 8-3 if the square of one side of a triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, then the triangle is right triangle.  8-4 if the square of the longest side of a triangle is less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides, then the triangle is an acute triangle 8-5 if the square of the longest side of a triangle is greater than the sum of the squares of the other two sides, then the triangle is an obtuse triangle. 8-6 (45-45-90 theorem) in a 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is the square root of two times as long as the leg. 8-7 (30-60-90 Theorem) in a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice as long as the shorter leg, and the longer leg is the square root of three times as long as the shorter leg.  9-1 if a line is tangent to a circle, then the line is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.  Corollary  tangents to a circle from a point are congruent. 9-2 if a line I the plane of a circle is perpendicular to a radius at it\u2019s outer endpoint, then the line is tangent to the circle. 9-3 in the same circle or in congruent circles, two minor arcs are congruent if and only if their central angles are congruent. 9-4 in the same circle of in congruent circles (1) congruent arcs have congruent chords. (2) congruent chords have congruent arcs. 9-5 a diameter that is perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord and its arc 9-6 in the same circle of in congruent circles, (1) chords equally distant from the center are congruent (2) congruent chords are equally distant from the center of the circle. 9-7 the measure of an angle formed by a chord and a tangent is equal to half he measure of the intercepted arc Corollary 1if two inscribed angles intercept the same arc, then the angles are congruent Corollary 2 an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle Corollary 3 if a quadrilateral is inscribed in a circle, then its opposite angles are supplementary 9-8 the measure of an angle formed by a chord and a tangent is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. 9-9 the measure of an angle formed by two cords that intersect a circle is equal to half the measures of the intercepted arcs 9-10the measure of an angle formed by two secants, two tangents,, or a secant and a tangent drawn from a point outside a circle is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 9-11when two chords intersect inside a circle, the product of the segments of one chord equals the product of the segments of the other chord. 9-12 when two secant segments are drawn to a circle from an external point, the product of one secant segment and its external segment equals the product of the other secant segment and its external segment 9-13 when a secant segment and a tangent segment are drawn to a circle from an external point, the product of the secant segment and its external segment is equal to the square of the tangent segment.

Actually, it wasn\u2019t that bad, there was just a lot of stuff to pack. On the other hand, though, my mother told me that I could go through the boxes on the shelves against one of the walls and sort out what I wanted to keep.  This was a good thing.  This was a very good thing.  Apparently both my mother and my aunt haven\u2019t been entirely on top of things, then again my grandparents had a lot of things they\u2019ve gotten over the years to sort through, and being the inquisitive person that I am (i.e. a professional snoop/researcher since I was four) I made a number of finds they missed.  The first was a black faux fur coat that had been stuffed away. It looks like a cross between a wrinkled velvet blanket and a teddy-bear skin gone wrong but I liked it, must be my grandmother\u2019s side of me poking up.  Come to think of it, if I was leaning that way in my thoughts, I would have said that the spirits of my grandmother and grandfather were guiding me in a way, or at least bludgeoning me because I\u2019m the only one in the family who apparently pays attention in a half-assed sort of way.  You see, aside from the coat, I also found five boxes of L.P.s (yep, good old vinyl) of all kinds of music, although most were of a classical or operatic nature...which means they had to have been my grandmother\u2019s.  Add to that, I found three boxes of sheet music and old books on music, and I do mean old! There are more than a few that will need to be re-bound, and one of them had the date of 1909.  The above two things were important because music was very important to my grandmother. For most of her life she had been taking singing lessons and was very, very active in the music community here in St. Louis. Both an opera and a night club singer, she was one of the hands that built an opera company here in the city, as well as for a time had a night club called 'The Lorelei\u201d in Gaslight Square (a very ritzy, night-club area of town in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s).   To say she was a character would be like saying that a diamond was just shiny. She was a big woman, both in height and personality, a real grande dam. Among her possessions was a navy blue dress studded with a wide swath of rhine-stones around the collar and cuffs. I won\u2019t tell you how many shoes she had specifically because I\u2019ve never bothered to count, but she loved shoes, and being the only member of my family with big enough feet to fill them, what my aunt didn\u2019t take for her remembrance, I inherited, and there were a lot! And all in their own labeled shoe-boxes.  As for personality, I can sum up my grandmother into two small anecdotes. The first I learned of shortly before she died...that when she and my grandfather owned \u201cThe Lorelei\u201d not only did she sing, but her last song for the night would be \u201cLet Me Entertain You.\u201d This would have been no big thing except for the fact that as she was singing she would pull the falsies out of her dress and throw them into the audience. Note for those of you too young to know what \u201cfalsies\u201d are and those too old to remember...to sum up they were the old-timey version of the wonder-bra, only instead of it being a bra, it was just two pads that you stuck into your bra to lift, create cleavage, and make the breasts look a bit bigger.  The second of these small anecdotes: the morning my grandmother died from her long fight with metastasized melanoma, barely able to speak clearly because of the second tumor in her brain, she sang \u201cLet Me Entertain You\u201d with all the energy she could. Grasping the arms of the hospital bed we had put in her room at home (she had wanted to die in her home with my grandfather), she shook the bed while belting out the song as best she could and laughed when she was done. On the 5th of November 1999, shortly after 10 p.m. she passed away.  My aunt, the eldest of the two daughters my grandparents had, and the only two children they had, practically beatified my grandmother into sainthood when she passed, or so it seemed. Seeing it from my perspective, and with what I know, although my mother thinks my aunt is off of her rocker, I can understand where my aunt is coming from to some degree, and that it\u2019s part of her grieving process. Note: after my grandfather\u2019s death, my mother and my aunt finally came to terms with the blatant truth that while my aunt is the emotional one, my mother is the logical one...and both of them can take it to extremes.   What can I say, my aunt and my mother are human...and then I can laugh, because I know I\u2019m human too, and have my own quirks.  The big find of the day though came when I found a box marked \u201csouvenirs & letters.\u201d Opening it up, I found a hard-cover, leather bound notebook/binder with \u201cStudents Note Book\u201d embossed on the cover sitting on the top. The first lined page was dated 28 November 1934, and as that the rest of the notebook had all the hallmarks of a Roman Catholic school education, I assumed it to have once belonged to my grandmother, and as that she was born in 1923, that at the time of writing this, she would have been 11 years old.  If that had not been enough, right below it was a manila folder marked AG-201\u2014Klatz, Harold D. (Civ), and within the folder were letters my grandfather had written to her while he was serving in World War II, and interspersed with them are letters she had written him and other odds and ends from what looks to be May 1943 through September 1943. I still have to sort through them, and as I do, I\u2019m typing them into the computer with the full intents of making them available on the internet as well on the grounds that even if my computer goes belly-up, I will still have access to them. Not to mention, maybe someone else will find them interesting as well.  I have to admit that when I first found the letters and rifled through them, I came across a hand-written \u201cNotice of Divorce\u201d with another line right below it which read something like \u201cso we can get married again, and again, and again.\u201d Beneath the introductory phrase was a kind of running list of what my grandfather apparently liked about my grandmother, and I couldn\u2019t help but bust out laughing. One line read \u201cbuilt like a brick shithouse in a strong wind\u201d which is very much the way I view the youthful version of my grandfather\u2019s wild sense of humor. Not long after that I was in tears, sad because I miss both of my grandparents (my grandfather died in June of 2003), and sad because their house had been sold...a kind of physical reminder of their existence. I\u2019m still kind of grieving, which is fine, it\u2019s a part of life and I can contend with it...so long as I find something besides my shirt to blow my nose on.  Lloyd\u2019s comment upon seeing the box once we got it home was \u201cYou could be going through this for the rest of your life.\u201d We found neat clippings of news articles, camp newspapers, and comics in just the second bundle of letters wrapped in a \u201cVictory Pack.\u201d  Well, it\u2019s already getting late, so off to bed I go.   Needless to say, I\u2019ve had a couple of great inheritance\u2019s plopped into my proverbial lap. A real find for a history and archaeology junky like myself. :-)  "}

After the sleep in and slight grumpiness at missing out on seeing the kids this morning due to my own stupidity ... I realise now that I needed today. To stay indoors, even though it is gorgeously sunny outside and just listen to some good music (Sweetback is still in the player), do some reading and writing for uni.  Disclaimer: The below post ended up being dreary. It wasn't meant to be.  I was able to chat to my dearest friend who lives in Portugal. S moved to Portugal after highschool and is now completing a degree in Architecture. She is coming to Australia with her beau for Christmas so it will be nice to meet her and her man. We both return to Sydney a few days from each other in December - should be nice. The only thing is that S can be too intoxicating. Over our chat I was reminded of a argument we had when we were 14. S has always been demanding - for everything. Friendship, attention, listening, dancing, and gifts. It isn't an evil thing - just in equal amounts she is generous and caring. And I totally love her. But even today I was reminded of this fact when she tapped away in our chat ' I should take the time to remind you to bring me a gift from the States.' She was probably 1/2 joking, no a 1/4 joking, but the insinuation was still there and reminded me of the time she badgered me about a birthday present weeks and weeks before the actual event. I always felt compelled at the age of 13 - 18 to buy her expensive presents - I don't know why. Looking back she would have remained my friend either way. It baffles me to be honest. So this one time I actually started saving - which was hard as I didn't have an after school job, and I came from a single parent house hold with a parent who was paying for private education for two kids, paying a mortgage and still trying to provide the absolute best for her kids. But still I tried to save and with her birthday looming her badgering started to pick up, until a few days later I totally blew up. We were in class, Commerce Studies. She was asking me questions about what I had bought her. I still hadn't purchased anything. There was a silver ring I thought she'd like, but the store didn't have lay-by and I hadn't saved enough. So after a million questions and me avoiding the questions - I blew up and told her off. I think I even threatended to hit her - thats how mad I was. I was asked to leave the room ('That kind of behaviour is not tolerated in this school'). Damage was done. We didn't speak and I never had to buy the present for her because of that. I think it set the tone for how I deal with stress. I blow up and then allow the matter to deteriorate... which brings me the other issue on my mind today ...  My mother. I may have mentioned a few blogs back that there has been a silent conversation going on between my mother and I. Kind of difficult some might think seeing as we live in the same house. But with our schedules we hardly see each other ... except for today. We have both been home. She downstairs. Me upstairs in my room. This made me along with other 'signs' think about what has been going on between us. My attitude towards her has been one of avoidance from May. It an accumulative thing. Years of arguing, tension, tears, pain - we both share for a multitude of reasons, but tend to target each other as the cause of it. After last years self rebirth I came to the realisation that I probably shouldn't keep my mother as my target of said suffering. And for a while that worked. I focused on the task at hand(uni, work, health, exercise, friends, relationship), and when our communication became too much to bear for me (her criticism, nagging and guilt-ridden comments) I would retreat. But the same old same old has resurfaced. Blame my Scorpion sensibility of never letting things die, as I like to refer to determination and ALWAYS being the one in the right in May of this year I did not want to retreat casually as I had done so in the last year - I wanted to fight! Tell my mother why I am in pain. What she did and didn't do to help me. And try to drum into her that I am now an adult, capable of so much more than what she sees. She probably still sees a baby, or young thing. I am not quite sure how to change this. I worked full-time for two years before I went back fulltime to uni and started part-time work, and she was still the same. Angry and Critical. The emotional side of me goes for 'Why am I the victim in this' take. The logical side of me says its a clash of egos and an argument on two different playing field.  Today, I go with the latter - but on my down days I can help but feel like the victim. The daughter who was always there to listen to her mother's woes, to help with looking after a younger sister, being well behaved, doing well at school, getting into a good uni, working in respectable good companies and organisations, having good friends and a long stable relationship with a guy who respects my family and especially my mother, being responsible, diligent, respecting my elders - ALL THOSE THINGS! But when the claws are out I am attacked on a personal level for not being good enough. And then I blow up. And fall back down at being the victim.  So the question remains... What do I do? An Aunt gave me some advice late 2003 when my mother had another episode. She asked me if I had faith. She knows that I no longer go to church every Sunday, and that I question Christianity. I answered that I do have faith. I have faith that with great belief in humanity that we can have peace and love. She asked me to pray for myself for strength to love my mother as she is and not to ask for anymore. She said with that strength I will be able to show my mother what I am capable of. The faith was for me only - for my own strength. I ask my Dad who I know is my Guardian Angel to give me that strength ever day.  My Aunt also asked me to have faith in one hand and reality in the other. She said I had two options. One was to go my own way and not deal with my Mother and our problems. The other is to use my strength and face reality that because of so many issues, my mother sees me as her point of attack. After losing her husband, my father - and feeling let down by him she has had to carry on with life and raise two children on her own. I am used as her 'punching bag' sometimes. So the choice was walking away and limiting contact with her, or staying there with inner strength, having a relatively normal relationship and every so often deal with the crap. Back then I went for the inner strength advice. Today I am not so sure. I have come to realisation that I want the following:  to talk to my mother openly about everything - past, present, future not to be criticised share her struggles and listen to her stories be loved by my mother  Right now I need to work on that on my own. For now the silence is the easiest sound to hear.  LovePeaceRespectHumility     "}

Sorry its been so long since I've last dropped a post, time does fly! Anyway while I'm enjoying my stay here in Puerto Rico I would like to get to the bottom of a  question I have.  First of all the basketball team down here I am able to practice with until I know if I can play or not (long story but basically its all about needing residency and if I can slide with just coming to visit ever since I was little every yr or if I officially have to be here for a year to qualify to play) has been real cool.  Talk about small world but I just happen to be playing with a girl who I was play against in college.  Her along with one other girl both are from the states so immediately it was just natural to bond with them first.  The one who I played against in college is real cool and pretty much goes with the flow like I do.  The other player is coo as well a bit of a different style somewhat keeps to herself and sleeps a whole lot but she can be down to earth as well.   For most of last week I was able to stay at their place a couple towns over since practice was right around the block from them.  Eventually to complete the beginning stage of me getting to know them ..I had to find out the question every female athlete has to another when they meet someone......are you gay? Ha yes unfortunately for all us female athletes out there the sterotype for us being gay is definitely growing.  I would say 1 out of every 4 women athletes are gay...however Wnba probably has a different ratio of probably 1 out of every 2 haha yup sounds about right! So to make a long story short one of my teammates I was staying with who I found out was gay convinced me and her other roommate who is straight to go to the club with her.  My first response was hell ya I havent shaked my ass yet in Puerto Rico since I've been here but then I put two and two together and realized it probably was a gay club...in the end I agreed I would go since the night we were going is open to everyone and plays really good music.   So how was my experience to my first gay club......ummm I guess it was o.k.  The first 40 minutes I had a blast since no one was really on the dance floor and  the three of us pretty much made our american mark with our style and dance moves..that was fun! As the time was ticking more and more people came on to the dancefloor..I would definitely say it was more gay men on the dance floor shaking their ass but there was still the hand full of girls dancing as well.  The tighter my dance space got the less I was shaking my ass haha if you know what I mean I just didn't know who would roll up behind me.  I knew it was time to stop dancing when the circle the three of us had formed (which has to be some unspoken dance floor agreement so you can keep the eye contact when you switch up the dance move so everyone in the circle is on the same page)that was now turned into more of a line from flaiming guys dancing on are right to gay girls basically banging pelvis together on our left.. that was pretty funny but somewhat disturbing at the same time because I definitely would not call that dancing. After that I was pretty much good to go..it just topped the cake once the transvestites started coming through I don't know why but they really scare me.  I don't know if it is the inch of makeup they cake on making them look like walking dolls or how raunchy they are and their need for attention and making a scene with everything they do.  Anyway I knew it was time to go once they started walking by me by two's.  What an experience..it was coo for what it was but probably not ever again..nothing against people who are gay at all but it was a little overwhelming once it got crowded.   Oh yea ...this all leads to a question I've always had stirring in the back of my head....in the gay community whats up with the older dating a younger person??? I don't get that at all but it seems to be very common in this community?? I even asked my teammate over here why after she told me a story of a crush of her's who is over 10 years older than her however her girlfriend is only a couple yrs older..just don't get it..and one of her girlfriends male coworkers is dating a young and let me reiterate young boy who is 14  years old..oh sorry did I forget to tell you the coworker is 43..and they live together! Now thats some shit! Anyone have any comments to this please leave one To end this log which ended up being much longer than I thought I would like to put the dumb quotes of the week by one of my teammates I was staying with last week.... In Puerto Rico she had a nerve to ask 'Do they sell Pineapples here'? The next one was by the same girl during practice after she shot and it just went hit into the rim 'Shooters bounce' ...Even after me and my other teammates corrected her she insisted that it wasnt shoooters roll' No its shooters bounce because it bounces in the hoop' What is this girl on???Who knows but I hope its not in the water! Thats all for now B EZ      "}

If you do, they might break your heart...if you don't, you might break theirs.  Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person?  Your heart decides whom it likes and whom it doesn't. ou can't tell your heart what to do. It does it on its own........when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.  Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?  Too many of us stay walled up because we are too afraid to care too much...for fear that the other person does not care as much, or even at all.  Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?  We tell lies when we are afraid... afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us.

As you enter Antalya you are greeted by a sign that says 'Altitude: 30.' This 30-meter difference between sea level and the city is the height of the cliffs on which it is built. These cliffs, which set Antalya apart from other coastal towns, are 13 kilometers long and from 30 to 50 meters high, a sight well worth taking in for the visitor. And the easiest way to enjoy the cliffs from up close is to make a short trip by sea. To do that, it's enough to go down to Antalya's oldest harbor, now called the Yacht Harbor, and cock an ear for the boatmen's call 'Selaleye gider' 'To the waterfall!' And after your boat leaves, filled with tourists from a variety of countries, all you have to do is lean back and let your eyes wander.  On this boat trip you will have a chance to see not only the cliffs, every square meter of which is a natural wonder, but also a number of points that dot them.     urlLink       For many decades, Antalya families who wanted to sun themselves and swim would come down to these tiny beaches, which are interspersed among the cliffs like so many oases in the desert. Especially popular was the locale known as the Kadinlar Hamami 'The Turkish Bath For Women' where women came without having to travel too far from town to enjoy the sea and summer in perfect privacy.   AN UNDERWATER FEAST FOR THE EYES   As they carried underground and surface water to the sea, these cliffs were also home to a number of facilities designed to exploit this flowing water for human use. Mills and power plants, for example. Literally gushing forth, the water would turn its energy into flour and electricity before going on to reach the sea. Thus it would bid farewell to the cliffs after providing humankind with bread, that basic food, and electricity, an indispensable element of civilization. These buildings are no longer used in our day. But there are other places associated with the cliffs, still in use and a must to see.     urlLink       Natural formations in the rocks continue to serve as chambers and storage space for various diving schools. Remember, diving along the cliffs is quite different from diving out at sea. Down to 20 meters or so the cliffs form a reef, and with their living organisms are a feast for the eyes. Of course one should also mention the submarine caves. It is not every holiday that offers the experience of swimming underneath the restaurant where you ate last night, or the nightclub where you danced.   THE ENCHANTING SONG OF DDEN   Just as we were thinking the vacation would not be complete without breakfast in one of the parks that top the cliffs, suddenly we began to hear that amazing sound. We had reached the Dden Falls, and the music of water kissing water was ravishing. Time seemed to stop on the boat. There was nothing but you and nature. If the captain didn't start the engine and turn the boat around, you could gaze forever into the whirlpool at the foot of the falls. Once back at the harbor where the trip began, you feel the slight intoxication of those who have been to sea.     urlLink       After a short break the trip along the cliffs will continue, this time by land and westwards. We can spend the break eating at a cafe in the Yacht Harbor. Or else sit somewhere on the clifftop taking in the view and contemplating. Many will be inspired to take photos, paint or draw a picture, or even write a poem.   As you resume your sightseeing, the hardest part will be deciding just which park to sit down in, and what direction to look. Let's say right off that the locale known as Tophane is home to one of the oldest tea gardens in Antalya. If you can find a table by the wall on the seaward side, do pause to refresh yourself with a glass of tea.   Looking up, your eye will meet the dazzling white walls of the old, but now restored, Antalya houses just above the harbor. Well, they certainly are tempting, but you'll have to visit them another day. For once you're in that quarter, you'll also have to see the Suna Inan Kirac Museum, the Hidirlik Tower, the Forty Steps, and quite a few other places.    urlLink        A SUNKEN SHIP: THE ST. DIDIER  500 meters out from the pier you'll notice a buoy in the water. Don't bother to look around, for there's nothing to see--the reason for the buoy's being there is down at the bottom of the sea. We're talking about the French ship St. Didier, which was sunk by German planes during World War II as it sought refuge in Antalya Harbor. If you like diving, you can still see the military equipment and material in the ship's hold.   Then, making your way along the western flank of the city, you'll notice how the Antalyans have furnished the entire shoreline with parks and paths, in order to enjoy the cliffs themselves and share them with visitors. Whenever you feel a little tired, or are simply taken by the impulse, have a break and enjoy the beauty in all its variety. Along Konyaalti Avenue there are a number of spots where you can descend the cliffs to the sea.   If you've scheduled some piece of business for after the cliffs, or have an appointment, you may have to postpone it. You'll see what we mean when you come to the end of your tour at Mehmetcik Park, which is named after the ordinary Turkish soldier.     urlLink       You'll need time just to contemplate the Mediterranean as it stretches away before you. And that's not counting the magnificent sight of the Taurus Mountains on your right, even more splendid where they meet the sea on the horizon. Is it a painting, or is it real?   In any case, take a few days to make yourself happy. Business can wait. You'll notice a statue overlooking the bay, alert as a sentry in its far-seeing gaze. A sentry who is Lycian, Byzantine, Seljuk and Ottoman all at once. An Antalyan, in other words, someone who belongs to the Mediterranean. Sit down beside him and enjoy the view. It will make you happy. You'll see.   Source:  urlLink Sky Magazine           "}

Dreams, as another general rule, are equally ill-equipped to deal with the present; and with reality, for that matter.  The former thinks mostly about the past; the latter, about the future and the what could be.  I'm a historian and a dream, therefore, I'm uniquely designed to think about everything except for this moment right now.  Which is rather amusing, really, considering I usually advocate a philosophy of 'live for the moment.'  It's one that I try to follow, but I also constantly think about what was and what could be.  I'm a study in contradictions, I guess.  The way I think about the past is probably not unique.  I have a certain amount of nostalgia for that which went before.  I'm more enamoured of the music that was made before I was born than I am of the crap they've got on the radio today.  I'm fascinated by the way politics and religion and philosophy worked in the distant past, back when what one believed was more important than money.  I also think of the past in more personal terms, recalling the joys and sorrows I've shared with those I love over the years.  I long for those moments from the past, to relive particular days, or hours, or even minutes of such pure bliss that the rest of the world ceased to exist as far as I was concerned.  I remember first kisses, telling someone I loved them for the first time, the laughter of a friend as I changed their bad day into a good one.  I remember the tears I shared with friends over loss, heartache, suffering, and just the random stupidity of life and an uncaring, random world.  Yes, my musings on the past are rather wistful, and just a touch bittersweet.  Sweet because so many of my memories are good ones, and so much of the more general history I've studied academically is interesting and fascinating to me.  Bitter because I know the personal memories are just memories, and I cannot relive them again, even if I am with those people once more.  No, time marches on, of course, and nothing I can do--especially wishing--will change that.  Also bitter to think that so many of the stupid mistakes our ancestors made are repeated on a daily basis, because we didn't study what came before us and thus cannot understand that these conflicts we keep fighting are not going to be resolved with a show of force and a taste of steel.  The way I think about the future is maybe a bit odder, though even it is probably not unique to me.  I am, as I said, a dream.  I dream of what could be, of what will never be, of things real and imagined.  I dream of the day when I become a professor in history, or even of the day an acceptance letter comes from one of the schools I applied to arrives in the mail.  I dream of finding the right girl, of discovering we are right for each other, marrying, and living the cliched 'happily ever after' that can only exist in a dream but never in reality, because everyone has to face a bumpy road.  And I dream that maybe I've already met her, that we're just waiting for that right moment in time to realize that we're meant for each other.  It's hard to say.  Funny thing is, I have a tough time acting in the present to enable me to realize my future, my dreams.  I keep thinking it'd be nice to be accepted to a great school for my PhD, but I've been putting off filling out applications.  I only finished off everything for another of them this afternoon, and it only took ten minutes to fill out the form, and a quick trip to the Post Office to send everything off.  So why am I so hesitant, so lazy?  It's not as though I was filling the rest of my time with excitement or important tasks that could only be done at that very moment.  Why can't I connect the past, the present, and the future altogether into one tread of chronology, and recognize that things which were done then have an effect on now, and things done now have an effect later?  Why are the three moments disconnected in my mind?  The past is easy enough to understand.  They say it's like a foreign country, a distant land which no one can visit.  Makes sense.  But why do I have such a difficult time accepting the fact that the things I want to do later require activity now?  I think it's because I'm a terrible planner, and I also expect things to just happen for me.  Life doesn't work like that, though.  It's really a good example of just how naive and sheltered I've been, though.  I realize on an intellectual level that I have to do things now to enjoy the benefits later, but a small part of me (a part which has a disproportionate control over my decision making to its size) keeps thinking everything will be literally handed to me.  That someone will see my comics, and suddenly I'll be famous and loved by many, that all sorts of folks will want to read them and give me money to keep making them.  Or that someone will hear Clif and I's music and give us a record contract, and we'll become the next Beatles.  Or I'll write some short story that gets me a big publishing deal and I'll be able to be a professional writer.  Not to discount those dreams: it'd be great to be a cartoonist, or writer, or rock star.  I would love any of them, and I do keep all three up with some sort of far-fetched hope that someday it'll pay off in more than just an artistic expression of ideas running around in my head, that someone else will appreciate them like I do and feel I deserve some sort of monetary compensation for all my hard work (yes, I want to sell out--but hey, saying you're doing it for the sake of the song is great, and I fully agree with it, but would you rather make music no one ever hears, or make music loved by millions and which makes you lots and lots of money, assuming it doesn't force you to abandon your artistic principles?  C'mon, I'm not a punk, I don't believe I lose credibility just because I make art that people  like ).  I think what it boils down to is that I do want things given to me, I don't want to have to work hard for them.  This is a huge personal defect, a gaping hole in an otherwise not too bad personality (wow, I think that still came out conceited).  I  can  work hard, I just don't like to without the certainty of success at the end.  I don't want to have to fill out applications to graduate schools without the assurance that I'll not only be accepted to the school, but I'll get a scholarship and I'll be able to get gainful employment upon graduation.    Perhaps another example is in order--exercise.  I hate to exercise, because I don't get immediate results.  It takes a long time for any visible result to manifest itself.  I mean, I run and run, and don't lose weight very quickly, if at all (though that's in part due to my eating habits, but that's another story).  I know there are many long-term benefits to exercising, I just don't see any immediate ones.  I hurt, I sweat, and I'm not noticeably thinner at the end of the workout.  So what's the bloody point?  It's why I lose interest in things like that (or like playing the guitar, which I've tried several times) so quickly--nothing tangible comes of it immediately, so why bother?  As I said, this is a pretty big problem, and one I struggle with every moment of every day in some form or another.  It could be that part of my problem is that I'm the product of a society which places such emphasis and importance on instant gratification, on the fulfillment of base desires right now.  But that's just a cop out, really.  If I'm truly interested in something, I should put forth the damn effort to achieve it, whether my effort is immediately rewarded or not.  I have to be in this for the long haul, I have to make this moment mean something not only for now, but for later.  I have to try, because dammit, what's the point in living for the moment if my moments on down the road are going to be empty, painful, and without purpose?  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: David Gray, 'Flesh'         "}

If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it  is man's number. His number is 666. Revelation 13    Prologue  What does the mark mean? What is the significance of 666? What does it mean? To answer all these questions, I will critically interpret the history of this two thousand year old mystery. This symbol generates great curiosity among many people and volumes of works have been written on it. In fact, the Google search engine pulls out 2,950,000 entries for \u201c666\u201d! This further indicates the depth of the subject matter. It is also noteworthy that the symbol has been abused and read into to promote unhealthy and non-Christian theology.  In this paper, I will argue that the number of the beast, 666, is merely the name of the beast and not a magical number of any kind. I will show that John indeed identified the mark (666) with the beast for he clearly states that the mark is the name of the beast. Therefore there is no need to read the text backwards starting with the mark in order to identify a certain beast\u2014this is the eisegesis I will argue against.   In Search of the Beast   The symbol 666 has been misinterpreted and misused for millennia. I will now survey some of its most significant misuses. Many people, like Gary Blevins1, believe that the mark will be an invisible laser tattoo injected under the skin or a microchip that will be placed under the skin for scanning at the point of trade. Such people ignore the fact that the original audience of the book, for whom Revelation was written, understood what John had communicated to them. Therefore, since lasers and microchips were virtually unknown 2000 years ago, this \u201cinterpretation\u201d should be discarded.     Other people like Blevins are literally obsessed with the number 666 and look for names that match them to identify the beast. Needless to say, such people can get stockpiles of names like the one Blevins2 mentions in his book, Ronald Wilson Reagan! It is interesting, though, that Ronald and Nancy Reagan are still haunted by this number. The Reagans retired to a house in 1989 at 666 St. Cloud Road, Beverly Hills.  Nancy had the address changed to 668!  Others do not count the letters of peoples\u2019 names to identify them with the beast but they look at their character, political affiliation and philosophy to see if they are the rightful owners of the mark, 666. Some of the people identified with the beast and given the mark include:  Yasser Arafat, Saddam Hussein, Anwar el-Sadat, David Rockefeller, Pat Robertson, Pope John Paul II, Martin Luther, Nero Caesar, Benito Mussolini, Jimmy Carter, Bill Gates, Mikhail Gorbachev, John F. Kennedy and Henry Kissinger. Other world known figures identified with the beast  in their time include: Willy Brandt, Caligula, King Juan Carlos of Spain, Emperor Frederick II of Germany, King George II of England, Emperor Justinian, Ayatollah Ruhulah Khomeini, Nikita Khrushchev, Sun Myung Moon, Napoleon Bonaparte,Czar Peter the Great, Pete Seeger, Josef Stalin, Kaiser Wilhelm and  Boris Yeltsin.  Other people like, Tal Brooke3, are more radical as they believe that global banking, laser scanning, and the universal bar codes are part of the 666! Brooke and others like him shun all signs of world unity including unity and the oneness of the Church and they see  World Council of Churches (WCC) and similar organizations as a sign of satanic globalism!\u2014obviously ignoring the fact that unity and oneness of the Church is what Christ prayed for! (John 17:11). Others, including M.J. Agee, believe that the mark may even be used as it appears in the Greek, , pointing out that the  middle letter, xi, resembles a serpent4; since serpent became a kind of Satan\u2019s nickname in the Bible, this is not a bad exegesis though too simplistic.  The newest edition of Oxyrhynchus Papyri contains a fragmented papyrus of Revelation which dates around 3rd century. This papyrus gives the beast number 616 instead of the customary 666. This was the western Roman Empire where Latin was dominant. Needless to say, 665 was not also uncommon. Irenaeus, a disciple of Polycarp,  quotes and refutes this 616 number5 but this papyrus is the earliest ever found giving the beast this odd number (see attachment #1).  But one may wonder why numbers matter. In fact, during the Roman era, numbers fascinated educated Greeks and playing games based on numerals was a popular pastime. This process was known gematria in Hebrew and isopsephia in Greek. The Greek numerals are represented by letters. For example, alpha =1, beta = 2 and theta = 9, and so on (see attachment #2). The quote below best illustrates the power of numerals among Roman era Greeks:  \u201cThis \u201cpopular parlour-game\u201d\u2026could be given a satirical or polemical slant. If numbers can equal words and phrases, they can also equal proper names. Take the Emperor Nero \u2026.In Greek, he is NERON (with an omega). Add up the values of these letters and you get 1005. Add up the letters of IDIAN METERA APEKTEINE (killed his own mother) and you also get 1005. So Nero = killed his own mother.\u201d6  It was thus easy to go from a word to its number and this did not take a rocket scientist. It only required some one who could read and add numerals as there was only one way to do it and it is impossible, though, to go backwards from the number to the name (words).        John\u2019s readers were familiar with the letter and number ratio as that was known by all who used letters of the alphabet for numerical systems. This process was always used to conceal the identity of the person in question. A well-known graffito by Pompeii (c. AD 79) says \u201cI love her whose number is 545.\u201d It is obvious that only those who knew her name or the names of the candidates could unlock this puzzle. It will be insane if a modern person tried now to figure out her name! Furthermore, The Hebrew letters of Balaam amount to 666 and the name of Jesus in Greek equals 888.    Many have suggested, too, that Nero was the beast (with the mark 666) implying that John\u2019s prophecy was already fulfilled. This means that no beast, whether his number is 666, 616, or 665, will ever show up again. This school of thought believes that Revelation is not a prophesy of what is to come but a relation with the immediate application of then and there in the first century. This view is known as preterist.            One reason people held this is the fact that Nero portrayed many of the evil signs of the beast. However, another reason is related to his name because the transliteration of Neron Caesar, his official name, into Hebrew is nrwn qsr that total the number 666. Even if spelled without the final n, it also becomes 616 counting for the other variant reading. Furthermore, Nero was known among his contemporaries as a \u201cbeast\u201d because of his ruthless behavior and poor ethics.  F.F. Bruce, puzzled by how people were obsessed with number said: \u201cThe three rules for making any name yield the desired 666 are: (1) if the proper name itself will not yield it, add a title; (2) if the sum cannot be found in Greek, try Latin, or Hebrew; (3) if that does not work, misspell it!\u201d7 Volkmar, Kliefoth and Moffatt said that the number is that of a specific individual though they did not name that person. However, it is important to know that John expected his audience to know the beast he was describing to them. John never meant to confuse his audience\u2014he wanted them to inform. Believers who saw (or will see) the beast had (will have) no trouble recognizing him. Believers should therefore avoid the supersonic prophets who are using bizarre and arcane tactics to identify the beast\u2014this is beside the point John was making for he never intended to be mysterious.   However, believers should not be caught up in this fanatic gematria because there is nothing that is magic with the generic number 666. For example, the Holy Bible equals 666 in gematria! Here is the how it works:   H  72 O  79 L  76 Y  89  B  66 I   73 B  66 L  76 E  69    Total 666         The above values I used are in fact ASCII computer alphabet code where, for example, A= 65 and Z=90. This computing system is internationally recognized and used as well. But this was merely to show that those who fiddle with numbers can make them say for them anything they want to hear. What numbers can be done is virtually infinite. Such gematria doesn\u2019t lead to any conclusion as it leads to every conclusion there is and this shows its deficiency. I pray that the madness of the \u201cChristian\u201d gematria stops here. One thing we can learn from this number, 666, is that God\u2019s enemies are numbered and that their deception will be over.     The Beast John Saw  Reading Revelation in its entirety makes clear that that John perceived Empire wide persecution in his time. Reliable sources indicate that such persecution did not take place until well into the 3rd century. However, it is absolutely possible, and it is the likelihood, that John had Nero in mind when he was describing the Beast with the mark as \u201ca man\u2019s name\u201d (13:18 NEB) indicates. Nero portrayed many of the characteristics of the beast including his demanding of his subject to address him as Lord and God. Nero also put a cast image of him in the imperial cult temples to be worshipped (cf. 13:14).     In his description of the beast, John presents to his audience some evil characteristics of Rome and her emperors, particularly Nero, known to his audience. The very description of the beast by John reminds his audience the evil inherent in the system and its emperors. As Andy Johnson put it eloquently:  \u201c\u2026Nero sat for the portrait that aspects of the beast was pattered after.\u201d8  It is also possible, that John had only one person in mind\u2014 one and only one and intended his audience to understand it that way as \u201ca man\u2019s name\u201d (13:18 NEB) indicates. This, though, does not rule out the fact that more beasts could emerge in the future as many emerged in the past and some are roaming around today propagating idolatry and blaspheming against the name of the Lord.   There is nothing in the text to indicate that the mark of the beast is literal though we should take the beast seriously. John did not obviously want his readers to take the beast with seven heads and ten horns literally. Why should he then expect them to take the mark literally? It is beside the point to use the mark 666 as magic jigsaw puzzle to predict the future.  When Revelation was read in worship services for praise and worship, the challenge was never to name the \u201cbeast\u201d who was persecuting the church by calculating the number (13:18)\u2014they already knew it but it was  to recall and recognize what it was\u2014that it was a beast empowered and used by Satan against the church. In fact, a more accurate translation of the exhortation of 13:18a would be \u201cIt is the moment to have discernment\u201d (Ellul\u2019s translation). This translation draws the attention of today\u2019s reader from the frantic decoding fever manifested in today\u2019s \u201cChristian\u201d bookstores \u201c to discerning where in our own time propaganda is used to idolize political power.\u201d9  John was limited by the culture he lived in and the language he used. John well knew that number seven is a number of completeness like when he speaks about the seventh seal, the seventh bowl and the seventh trumpet. John also uses number six as one of incompleteness and judgment\u2014a judgment which comes in the sixth seal 6:12-17 (physical disturbances), in the sixth trumpet 9:13-21 (mankind killed) and the sixth bowl 16:12-16 (Euphrates dried). John and other believers lived under the sixth Roman Emperor known for his brutality. \u201cSix-six-six\u201d is thus the intensive symbolic expression of incompleteness, idolatry, judgment, and non-fulfillment, evil itself raised to the third power. The number is communicated as symbol, not as by analysis.\u201d10  It is also important to know that the repetition of some thing three times was and still is an Eastern way to expresses emphasis. This kind of threefold repetition is seen throughout the Bible and in Eastern literatures as well (cf. Isaiah 6:3; Revelation 4:8). Because six is repeated three times, to make 666, it is to show how complete and perfect his evil ways and ungodliness are.     The Source of the Mark  It is strongly possible that John is getting his concept of the mark from Ezekiel 9: 3b-4 \u201cThen the LORD called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side 4 and said to him, 'Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it.'\u201d Some scholars have also suggested that John may had in mind the Roman coins which bore the images and the names of the emperors (see attachment #2) used to buy and sell commodities or the imperial seals then in use. \u201cThis has a parallel in the Jewish prohibition of images, which for some, such as the zealots, included the image of the emperor on Roman coins.\u201d11   Since the mark is said to be put on the hand and on the forehead, it is unlikely that John meant the coins. John could have been inspired by many more \u201cmarks\u201d prevalent in his time like the Jewish phylacteries12, square leather boxes containing scripture passages  worn on the left hand and forehead\u201d used as a sign of piety for the ultra-pious in the 1st century; (cf. Matthew 23:5). The fact that the mark of the beast is put on the right hand, and not on the right hand, is an obvious discrepancy but it is still possible that the mark was modeled after the phylacteries.   Regarding the imperial seals, Deissmann found evidence in the \u201cpapyri for a stamp printed on deeds of sale with the name and year of the reigning emperor\u2026.Deissmann observed that the brand embodied the name or number of the beast (v 17), concerning buying and selling\u201d.13 This finding is very significant.   According to Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology, the Greek term, Charagma, mark, was very commonly used for imprints on documents or coins, too. \u201cCharagma is well attested to have been an imperial seal of the Roman Empire used on official documents during the first and second centuries.\u201d14 The only other reference to charagma, in the New Testament (outside Revelation) occurs in Acts 17: 29 where it certainly stands for an image formed by art with design and skill. It is also known that the charagma was a kind of brand used in the Roman era to brand the disobedient or runaway slaves. Their mark always indicated one of ownership very much like brands of cattle today. Tattooing for religious purposes was also widespread. Roman soldiers also willingly bore the name of their most liked General tattooed or branded on them.  It is clear from the context, though, that John did not expect real literal branding or tattooing on his followers. His whole point was to make a spiritual point using a known customary practice to communicate a spiritual point.   A Literal Mark or a Metaphor?  This concept is first used in Exodus 13:9 as a metaphor \u201c This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that the law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For the LORD brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.\u201d But if we take literally that the beast will put a literal mark of 666 on the hands and foreheads of his followers (13:16), we will be required by logic and context to admit, too, that believers will have 777, the supposed number of God, or any other good mark on their hands and foreheads (7:3). The point I am driving home is that what is true of one group should be true of the second group for it is written that they will both carry marks (13:16;14:1) on their skins.  However, one plausible explanation of the marks that the groups receive is to say that they are merely spiritual likeness: those who worship God have the spiritual likeness of God and those who worship the beast have the spiritual likeness of the beast. This way of understanding the marks seems the most faithful to John\u2019s rendering of the marks.     As Augustine said, \u201cThe mark in the right hand and forehead implies the prostration of bodily and intellectual powers to the beast's domination. 'In the forehead by way of profession; in the hand with respect to work and service.\u201d15 This is another way to make sense of the mark and literalism fails its proponents miserably.   The beast with the ten horns and the seven heads, the leopard-bear-lion unit will also need to be taken literally by the \u201cliteralists.\u201d Therefore, the truth is that neither the \u201cdinosaur\u201d horns nor the marks are literal but metaphors. There will not be a need to write literal writings on people but their deeds will spell out, loud and clear, where each one\u2019s allegiance is.  Those who refuse to bow down to the beast by aligning themselves with God will be denied the basic necessities of life like food, shelter and clothing\u2014a kind of trade sanction. The whole earthly system will count against them, but they will win at the end of the day.   The truth of the matter is that there are countless beasts that came and went since John wrote his Revelation. Everyone who \u201csits for the portrait of the beast\u201d qualifies as one. There will certainly be more beasts to come\u2014I do not know how many but the obsession with one, single, specific beast coming at the end of the age with a literal 666 mark on him should be discarded. Also, as words need to be translated, symbols, too, need to be translated\u2014including the symbol of the beast, the much dreaded mark.     The Violated Book  This book is very well known and for the wrong reasons usually. Though it is the last book of the sixty-six books of the Bible, it happens to be the first book many people read. It is certain that someone who has not read yet the first sixty-five books of the Bible has nothing to do with this book as it doesn\u2019t offer anything significant that is new.  The problem often starts when people assume the book to be a guideline about what is to happen in the future\u2014a kind of a key for the unknown. Such people think that Jesus gave John a detailed future plan from the beginning of the world to the end. They also believe that the book details how the world will end and when it will end, too!  Many people believe that the Revelation of John foretold the 1st and the 2nd World Wars, the invention of the atomic bomb, the rise of USSR and even its ref flag, the rebirth of the State of Israel, and the ongoing Middle East conflict. No wonder then that this book is used by non-Christians like new Age groups and many fortunetellers to manipulate and confuse the na\u00efve.   Many of these people went far enough as to set a time when the world will end using Revelation! Others established small and dangerous cults and armed themselves to the teeth to fight the beast they claimed was represented by the United States. The Davidic cult of Waco, TX, best illustrates this. Needless to say, all these people missed the mark miserably.       Martin Luther despised Revelation as a Christian book very much like James (which he called \u201can epistle of straw\u201d) and John Calvin wrote commentaries on the 66 books of the Bible save Revelation! The way the NT was finally put together also speaks volumes. Though Revelation was not the last book written (2nd Peter is), it finds itself at the end of the NT\u2014this is not an accident.        The message of the book, however, should be clear\u2014it is that God wins and triumphs over evil. For this book to be helpful to Christians, its writer should not be seen as a kind of omniscient secretary of God who knew the future. It is compatible with our faith to accept that the writer did not know the future but merely had a strong conviction that God will not abandon his servants in the face of deadly threats and that evil will finally be defeated.                It is true that the whole book of Revelation is abused but chapter 13 is certainly the most vandalized. It is sad that many people who do not take the Bible  seriously and live a life without Christ take the mark of the beast literally and sometimes become fanatics! What is so different with this number? It is as though Jesus said \u201call the Law and the Prophets hang on that number\u2014666!\u201d       Many Christians have been offended by this very exploitation of chapter 13, especially verses 16-18. This passage was used as a basis for occult practices, science fiction movies, propaganda against the European Union (EU) and the Uniform Product Code (UPC). Others have claimed credit cards and social security numbers are the mark of the beast. No wonder that many Christians do not read Revelation let alone reading chapter 13 alone for their private devotions or public worship. It is as though Revelation became a spiritual liability.         However, this is not to ignore that many people (maybe, out of curiosity) indeed want to receive the mark of the beast! One may wonder why but the beast and his distinct mark\u2014666 became exotic and cool for many spiritually blind people who think the beast as a joke or a fabulous thing to be sought after! Here is one practical research that could shock the sensible:  \u201cA very informative 'Mark of the Beast' 'spoof' was recently staged on the Internet by Bill Cross. Bill wanted to try his hand at setting up a website. Bill decided for his first project, 'a spoof website of a company peddling the mark of the beast'. So Global Monetary was created with the advertising 'Become an IDchip member and Receive $250!'. Not wanting to cause real panic, Bill admittedly laced the site, 'with enough clues so that anyone who scrutinized it would know it wasn't for real and would therefore not panic.' Bill was surprised, 'On the first full day of operation the site had more that 4,200 distinct user sessions averaging 6 minutes each'. Emails began pouring in from hysterical Christians, privacy enthusiasts, the media world requesting interviews, and many who recognized it was simply a 'joke'.  Realizing things were getting 'out of hand', after just four days, Bill 'pulled the plug' on Global Monetary.   Bill also made this 'alarming' statement, 'I realized that I was getting another kind of visitor to the site: People who actually wanted to receive the mark of the beast just to get in on the IPO. I was totally blind-sided by that. I never expected that to happen. . .'16  How could one explain this unfortunate finding? The only explanation I know is that, out of ignorance, many people are playing with fire and they need serious help. It is time for the church to step up and save the na\u00efve.  Many of these people are fascinated by the \u201cpower\u201d of the beast and their subtle dualism kicks in and that is why they give too much attention to the beast and admiration for his miracles. They are like the ones who shout \u201c\u201dWho is like the beast? Who can make war against him\u201d (13:4). I must be quick to mention that the beast has no power other than that he was temporarily given by God. John did not leave this unsaid; he says that the beast, like his lieutenant, is out there just to deceive. The beast\u2019s lieutenant, certainly another beast, (13:11) \u201chas two horns like a lamb\u201d, John writes. A horn was supposed to show authority, strength and power. It is the rule of the jungle that animals with horns, tusks, and fang-like teeth best survive in the bush where only the fittest survive. But what about the little stubby non-fatal lamb horns the beast has? They are fake! The beast wants to pretend that he has real power and authority to bully the inhabitants of the earth but he doesn\u2019t\u2014his power is artificial and his horns are not horns. This alone should quench the idolatrous passion many people have for the beast and his demons for they are weak creatures that are not in match with the Creator.        Epilogue  Regarding the mark, it should not be taken literally as I illustrated above. This is what consistence requires. Furthermore, it is true that theories on this issue change allot faster than I can mention. The only unchanging and reliable thing to do is to remain true to Revelation itself. John shares some important specifics about the mark:  \u00b7No one is exempted from  receiving the mark (13:16). This is a worldwide campaign, everyone will get the mark. No class of people or age group is exempted.    \u00b7The mark and worshiping the beast are inseparable twosome (14:9; 14:11; 16:2; 19:20; 20:4). Five out of the seven times the mark is mentioned, it is directly tied to worshipping the beast. No one will get the mark by mistake or accidentally. One has to worship the beast to get it.   \u00b7The beast owns this mark (16:2; 19:20). This mark is the beast\u2019s and it stands in contrast with God\u2019s mark. The mark of the beast is bogus mark fashioned after God\u2019s. God\u2019s mark is for protection\u2014even for disobedient  sinners like Cain: \u201c13 Cain said to the LORD , 'My punishment is more than I can bear. 14 Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.'  15 But the LORD said to him, 'Not so; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over.' Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.\u201d Genesis 4. Ezekiel 9 also says: \u201c4 and said to him [the Lord], 'Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it.' 5 As I listened, he said to the others, 'Follow him through the city and kill, without showing pity or compassion. 6 Slaughter old men, young men and maidens, women and children, but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.' So they began with the elders who were in front of the temple.\u201d This is the mark of God giving life but the forged mark of the beast takes life and takes it painfully.   \u00b7It is either the name of beast or the number of his name (13:17). Though whether the mark is literal or metaphor is debated, one thing is certain\u2014people will get it. Whether people choose to get the number or the name, it is all the same at the end of the day\u2014it is probably only a matter of style and fashion but they all lead to death, a painful one. Christians should avoid adding up numbers in order to identify the beast for once the beast comes he will not be able to hide. There is nothing magic with the number  666 for it is found other places in the Bible (1Kings 10; and 2Chronicles 9).   I have never heard of anyone identifying King Solomon with the beast (anti-Christ) though Solomon was most noted for, among others, his great wisdom, his introduction of idolatry to Israel  and for rebuilding the Temple. It is precisely these three things, among others, that the beast will also do. Sooner or later, if the madness of playing with numbers continues unchecked, a liar will open his mouth and say that Solomon was the beast.  \u00b7No one can sell or buy without the mark (13:17). An economic boycott, and starvation therefore, awaits those who reject worshiping the beast. Because of the beast\u2019s one world order, there will not be a hiding place. Those who do not accept the mark will indeed be killed. The function of the mark is therefore to allow one to buy and sell as it is also a symbol of allegiance.     \u00b7Anyone who receives the mark will not be saved (14:9-11) The matter of worshipping the beast is one of personal decision. Whoever decides to worship him denies himself or herself of salvation.  Revelation 14 says \u201c...If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on the forehead or on the hand, 10he, too, will drink of the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. He will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. 11And the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark of his name.'  May we be the ones who worship the Lord alone and shun the beast, the master deceiver.     Source:   BLib 9176           Endnote  1.1. Gary D.

{"id": 247547, "author_id": 3451090, "gender": "male", "age": 23, "topic": "Education", "sign": "Capricorn", "date": "11,June,2004", "text": "                  urlLink   I just had a wonderful afternoon and night with my favorite sockle, Catie.  We caught 'Shrek 2' together, which we enjoyed.  We both agreed that Puss in Boots reminds us of Airick, especially when doing his huge kitten eyes followed by his ferocious attacks.  They even look alike, although Airick doesn't often carry an epee or wear a wide-brimmed hat.  After the movie, we visited the mall for some window shopping.  While there I found some great stuff, including an awesome kitchen table with a reversible top for card playing and a bumper pool table BUILT IN! How amazingly awesome is that?! True, it's not like a foosball table, but um...you can't play Euchre on a foosball table! The whole deal cost $600, but that included 4 rolly chairs and the table, plus the cues and pool balls.  I just priced it out online, and no one seems to come close to that price.  So...I may go to SticksNStuff tomorrow and buy it.   urlLink   Zoinks!  Somebody stop me.  I'm OOC with my money this weekend.  I also bought a cool zip-up sweater from H&M.  It's red, white, and blue and it only cost me $13 (originally $26), so I'm already starting to buy for New York's autumn.  This goes along with the great deals I got on Wednesday -- slate gray corduroy pants ($45.00 discounted to $9.77), a knit green polo ($45.00 discounted to $9.77), an awesome Havana shirt (long sleeve, navy blue, very thin cotton, and open at the neck -- $36.00 discounted to $11.99), and a very cool 1950's style button-down short-sleeve shirt in red with two thick white stripes running along the buttons ($40.00 discounted to $9.77).  What can I say, I'm a shopping whizz! (Thank you Kris, my shopaholic girlfriend, for your excellent tips...though I was  not  impressed by the clearance stuff at Aeropostale...or Aeropostatle, as my mom refers to it.)  I attempted to get my cartilage pierced tonight, but no one at the mall can pierce a hoop.  Apparently I've gotta keep a stud in for 8 weeks before I can move to a ring.  Grrr.  I've gotta tell Brad, 'We are readeeeeeeeehhhhh to get tattooooooooed.' Catie thinks his tattoo guy can help me out with my piercing. [Story still developing.]  Yeah, I'm getting pierced again.  Deal.  I'm a student -- I should be an even greater exemplification of free expression and nonconformity.  Plus, I look hot with an earring.  And I've already got a soul patch, so I may as well complete the slacker look.  My recent Amazon order came.  I got the Crows' 'This Desert Life' and I'm pretty impressed.  Favorite song: 'Amy Hit the Atmosphere.' Probably an odd pick, but there's something sorta haunting and sad about it.  Okay...that description fits just about  every  song sung by Adam Duritz, but it's especially true for this one.  I like the repetition of 'And that's all that really matters to me.' Such a great effect.  I'm slightly bummed that I'm missing the Crows concert this July.  They're playing in Columbia, MD (about 20 minutes away) and Brad and I planned on going.  The tickets were a bit steep ($30), but I'd be willing to fork it over to see my band.  Oh, well...the assistantship couldn't be passed up, even if I could've seen my band.  :(  Still no tour dates for NY or PA, so who knows if I'll catch them this summer? I may have to resign myself to CDs.  Speaking of concerts, the Vertical Horizon one utterly suctioned.  Not only did I wait in the rain for over an hour, but I did so after taking money out of a non-M&T ATM (thanks for the $2.75 service fee, plus M&T's $1.25 charge).  Oh, wait...but they didn't start their set at 7p.  They didn't go on until 10p-ish.  The opening band started sometime after 8p.  I gave up by 7:30p and walked around the Harbor talking to Chris for the next hour-plus.  I'd just come off a 10.5 hour shift at work, all I wanted to see was Vertical, but that definitely didn't happen at the scheduled start time (and I was told by the concert promoters they were playing at 7p).  To top off the perfect night, Tomm and I got into a stupid fight about whether journalism is analytical (I argued for the defense).  Somehow that spun into a huge yell fest complete with the F-bomb.  You know you're a dork who lives with a geek when you fight over the scholarliness of reporters (Like Fox News, we journalists report  and  decide.)  What else? I received my 'Wait, Wait' tickets yesterday.  I'm so excited to see the show again...twice in three months.  How many dorks can claim that?  My room is currently a disaster.  My floor is covered in papers, envelopes, receipts, and things desperately in need of storage.  Somehow I've acquired more than I ever thought possible during my short ten months in Maryland.  I'm still re-reading 'Otherland' (I'm on page 2000), but I've got a new bathroom read, Lynn Truss' 'Eats, Shoots & Leaves.' It's a book all about proper punctuation and the sticklers who enforce those rules.  I wouldn't think the audience was huge for such a subject, but I resolved to buy it once I heard Truss interviewed on an excellent edition of  urlLink 'Fresh Air' . (I sure reference that show a lot! If you don't listen to it by now, you really don't know what you're missing.  Terry Gross sometimes isn't the best interviewer, but she always scores interesting subjects.) Well, turns out I'm not the only person who thinks this book is amazing...it's No. 1 on the NYT Best-sellers List.  I fell asleep on the couch this afternoon while watching President Reagan's funeral procession.  During my nap, I dreamt I was an only child living in a ranch in DC.  Only DC looked like Kansas.  And my dad was this skinny guy in a sailor's dress uniform who tried to impress me by telling jokes and dancing  a la  Fred Astaire.  Once he was through, I opened the front door and looked up at the sun ('as memories of Venus' transit danced through his head') to see mountains of fire hurling down on the horizon.  It was like that dream where I'm running to get out of the way of the falling helicopter, but even though it crashes far away, it still rolls toward me and almost chops me up, except that I wake up.  Anyway, I knew that the fire bombs were coming for me, and sure enough -- though they blasted a mountain on the horizon (apparently DC-Kansas isn't entirely flat) -- a huge wall of fire raced toward my home.  My mom (who looked like Auntie Em from 'The Wizard of Oz') rushed me into the cellar and we hid under the stairs.  I kept trying to coax Airick to hide under the stairs with us, but he stubbornly sat just out of reach, and I thought for sure he'd get toasted.  That's when I awoke.    urlLink   I'm still waiting for my new checks.  I ordered a Muppet set, complete with Kermit, Piggy, Animal, and Fozzie.  When I received them, they contained Raggedy Anne and Andy.  I called my sister and asked her if a bunch of dolls on my checks didn't make her wonder if they'd gotten the order wrong.  She thought it seemed strange, but apparently it was within the realm of possibility of something Jay might adorn his checks with. urlLink     Well, let me set the record straight: While I may occasionally stray to some more effeminate interests, I guarantee that I will never in a million years put two stupid, and quite scary, dolls on my checks.  Even in my most ironic moment, I still wouldn't stoop  that  low.  I'm sure I could write more, but I'm getting a bit sleepy, so I suppose that's enough for now.  One more quick plug: Big Hits of the 90s on Yahoo's  urlLink Launchcast  is amazing.  This is the radio station that I hope someday to put on the XM.  Almost every song is a favorite of mine -- Toad the Wet Sprocket's 'Walk on the Ocean' just started playing.  Score.  :)             "}

Me : 13   Me : well, 7, if you don't count the dead ones  &nbsp;  See? I can be funny. Sadistic, yes, but funny.  &nbsp;  Dude, The Shins have broken through. That opening 'Woo!' on 'Kissing the Lipless,' was played on the Johnny Depp 'A2Z.' Obviously, I know that everyone who viewed that program immediately rushed over to the internet to find out who screamed that godly 'Woo!' You know it.  &nbsp;  Did anyone else crack up when that black guy on '99 said it took him four or five times to understand  The Sixth Sense ? Mmmm. I could live forever off of that stuff.  &nbsp;  I watched  The Big Lebowski  today. For the first time. I know, I know, it's horrible. Not the movie, the fact that it was released in 1998 and right now it is 2004. Goddamn, that is my kind of movie. Just a long, nonsensical, and lazy&nbsp;yet complex&nbsp;plot and John Goodman rambling about his experiences in 'Nam. So so funny and unique. And I almost cried. Seriously, after they dumped out the ashes and Dude yells at Walter for all the 'Nam references and Walter just hugs him... damn. I want to make a movie like that. I just want to make movies.  &nbsp;  What happened to that dream? My dream of being like Brendon Small and making a bunch of movies? I'll tell you what, it died, because I lost interest. I mean, I still really want to do it, I'm just not creative enough right now to write anything. I had that one script, and I think it was funny, but I lost interest and didn't find it funny after playing around with it so much. For the longest time, I've just wanted to direct a movie to see what it feels like. I think I could do a good job at it. Hmm.  &nbsp;  But like I said in a conversation with Kit, 'I don't have the persistance to make anything bigger than a sandwich.'  &nbsp;  Oh shit! Speaking of 'Home Movies,' Soup2Nuts is releasing a three disc DVD set of 'Home Movies' on November 13th. This is very, very good news.  &nbsp;  What the hell? They played part of the chorus of Denis Leary's 'Asshole,' song during '99, except they bleeped out the word Asshole. So all you hear is  BLEEP oo-ee-ooo-ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oole! So stupid. Why put it in there if they're just going to bleep it? VH1 needs to lower their bleep usage. Like during the South Park part, when Chef said ' BLEEP  on my Chocolate Salty Balls. Put 'em in your mouth and  BLEEP  'em.' You guys, God, the song is about a tasty salty chocolate snack. He is talking about eating his wonderous product that he slaved over in order to make some money. It is not some lude reference to oral sex. Christ. Get your minds out of the gutters.  &nbsp;  Haha, I said that the black guy  slaved  over his food. Get it? Because we used to whip black people and make them do our chores without pay or food stamps.  &nbsp;  I'm gonna be talking about 'I Love the 90's,' a lot for the next couple weeks, because it will be all I will be watching. Reruns have never been so tasty good.  &nbsp;  I recieved a junk e-mail from someone that called themselves Shovelful B. Ferreted.  &nbsp;  I found part of my script thingy. Opinions?:   (A man holding an ancient-looking statue runs down a road, being distantly pursued by nine security guards. The guards lose track of the man when they come to a fork in the road, so they stop to figure out which way he went)  Head Guard: Which way did he go?  Guard 1: I think he went that way! (points to left road)  Guard 2: No, no, no, I saw him go that way. (points to right road)  Head Guard: Okay, we'll split up. Half of you go that way (points right) and the rest of you come with me.  Guard 3: Hey, wait a minute!  Head Guard: What?  Guard 3: Well, it's just that.. there's nine of us. We can't exactly split in half.  Guard 4: Yeah! If you divide nine in two parts, you get four and a half! And we don't have a half-person with us!  Guard 5: We could make one. And if we're going to chop somebody in half, I propose that it be Johnson.  (Everybody but Head Guard and Guard 2 nod and mutter in agreement)  Guard 2: Shut it Langston!  Head Guard: Look, we're not cutting anybody in half! You four go that way, and the other four of you come with me! Now let's go! He's getting away!  Guard 4: Wait, that's not fair at all. We can't divide into uneven groups. What if he isn't working alone and we get outnumbered!  (Others mutters in agreement again)  Head Guard: Then what do you suggest we do?  Guard 3: Well, since there's nine of us, why don't we split into three groups of three?  Guard 1: But where would the third group go?  (A couple seconds of silence pass by)  Guard 2: Umm... How about they go back to the house?  Head Guard: Back to the house? But then there wouldn't be enough people out looking for the thief! Come on people! We need everyone out here looking for the statue! Now let's go!  Guard 5: How about I just go back to the house and you guys go look for the statue?  Head Guard: (Hesitates while contemplating the query) ...Alright, you head back to the house. You four! That way! You three! With me!  Guard 1: Why does he get to go back! It's cold out here and I have to go to the bathroom! I should get to go!  (Other guards chime in with their own reasons why they should go back to the house)  Head Guard: Everybody shut up!  (Guards all stop talking, except Johnson, who decides to finish his story when the others are all quiet)  Guard 2: ...and I left my hemorrhoid cream back there.  (Everyone backs away and looks at Johnson with glares of disgust)  Head Guard: Johnson... Christ, that's gross.  Guard 2: (pause) They.. they aren't contagious.  (Long pause)  Head Guard: People! We are getting off topic here! That man stole the statue, and if we don't get it back, Klein is going to fire us! Is that what you want?  Guard 4: You know, he's right. We really should be out looking for that guy.  (Other guards all cough-talk phrases like, 'Bullshit' and 'Suck up')  Guard 4: No! I'm being serious! How about we just have some kind of tournament to determine who gets to go back to the house?  Guard 1: Yeah! We could all play rock-paper-scissors!  Guard 3: No, we should have a basketball tournament!  Guard 5: You guys are so lame. A Magic tourney is the only sure-fire way to decide.  (Other guards simultaniously make their own suggestions)  Head Guard: You guys, come on!  Guard 1: Yeah, we all have our own ideas, so arguing is pointless. We need to think of a way to determine who's idea for a contest we should use to determine the tournament that will determine who gets to go back to the house.  Head Guard: If we don't leave in the next 30 seconds, you're all going back to the house in body bags.  Guard 3: Bags? Hey! How about we have a potato sack race?!  Guard 1: That's perfect! Jonas, you brought your bags with you, right?  Guard 4: Psh. When don't I? (pulls nine bags out from behind his back)  (Guard 4 walks around and hands out the bags to each guard. They all get in a line and prepare to start the race, except for the Head Guard.)  Head Guard: STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT!  (Guards all quiet and stare at Head Guard with confused looks)  (Head Guard pulls out his pistol and shoots Guard 5, killing him; When Guard 5 falls to the ground, Guard 4 goes down by his side)  Guard 4: No! You shot Terry! (starts sobbing) You shot Terry!  Head Guard: (While Guard 4 is still complaining) All right! Now there's only eight of us! Now can we please! Go and get the statue back!  Guard 4: (Looks up at the sky) Don't worry Terry! I'm coming with you!  (Guard 4 pulls out his pistol and shoots himself in the head and slumps over Guard 5's body)  Head Guard: Oh, fuck this.  (Head Guard slumps away in the direction of the house, slowly followed by all the other guards)  Guard 3: (to Guard 1 as they are walking toward the house) I told you they were gay.  (Then star-wipe, and.... cut)  &nbsp;  I know, it's short. But at least I wrote something.  &nbsp;  Kit should really start trying to write her Tech Deck mockumentary. Then we can bring it to life in film.           "}
{"id": 582213, "author_id": 4091880, "gender": "male", "age": 42, "topic": "Transportation", "sign": "Gemini", "date": "16,August,2004", "text": "   What is a Libertarian?? By now you've probably heard at least a little something about the Libertarian party. Libertarians have had a Presidential candidate on the ballot in all fifty states for the past three election cycles, and the Badnarik campaign is well on its way to making this year's election number four. We have candidates running for local and state level positions all across the country, and currently boast over 600 Libertarians in public office. Many people are even aware that the Libertarian party is the third-largest political party in American politics.   In spite of all this familiarity, the one question that many people still seem to have is, ``What exactly is a Libertarian??`` People with conservative beliefs often see us as ``liberal`` because of our outspoken defense of personal freedoms -- like the freedom of expression, or the freedom for peaceful adults to decide what to eat and drink, and how to raise their children. On the other hand, people with liberal beliefs tend to see us as ``conservative`` because of our staunch defense of economic freedoms, including the freedom for people to trade with one another in a way that they decide is in their own best interest. These misconceptions say more about the prejudices of the people who hold them, than they do about the Libertarian perspective.  Despite all the confusion, the Libertarian philosophy is especially easy to understand. Libertarians are, quite simply, people who believe in ``Self-Ownership``: I own myself, and nobody else on Earth has a higher claim to my body or my labor than I do. Likewise, we have a deep respect for other peoples` self-ownership: You own your body, and so long as you're acting in a way that doesn't interfere with anyone else's freedom, you should be free to do what you please.   The idea of ``Self-Ownership`` is what is what distinguishes us from both liberals and conservatives. Every political position that Libertarians take can be traced back to this simple idea. For example, Libertarians are opposed to ``liberal`` attempts to use the government to regulate people`s buying practices by imposing tariffs on certain goods and industries. We oppose this kind of regulation not because we think that all goods and industries are equally wonderful, but because we believe that people own themselves, and can decide what to buy based on their own beliefs and values. If for some people that means buying fair-trade coffee at the local co-op grocery store, then that's great -- just as long as they don`t use the government`s power to force other people to do the same.   Likewise, Libertarians are opposed to ``conservative``attempts to use the government to regulate people's morality, by imposing laws that restrict their behavior on the Sabbath, or at the pharmacy, or in the bedroom. We're opposed to these kinds of legal restrictions not because we think that all lifestyle choices are equally worth pursuing, but because we believe that people own themselves, and can decide how to live their lives as they see fit.  If you're not conservative and you are not liberal, where do you fit on the political spectrum?   The traditional left-right spectrum is one that political scholars have recognized as incomplete for some time. In fact, it is really only useful for tracking the answer to one question: ``What part of your life do you think government should control?`` On the left-hand side of the spectrum we find people who believe that it is the government's job to regulate our economic lives ; that is, our interactions with one another that involve exchange. Democrats and Green party members tend to be on this end of the spectrum. On the right-hand side, we find people who believe that it's the government's job to regulate our social lives. Republicans and Constitution party members tend to be on this end of the spectrum. This one-dimensional view of politics as something for controlling one area of life or another, explains why many libertarians cringe when we hear congress talk about passing ``bipartisan legislation''  The closest you can come to charting Libertarians on a one-dimensional left/right spectrum is to plot us directly in the middle of the two extremes. This is the only place on the line where you could put people who don`t believe in controlling each others lives either in an economic or a social sense. However, this fails to take into account that, like all other political groups, Libertarians come in varying degrees. It also makes it difficult to find a place to put people who believe that government should control both economic and social decisions.  It seems clear that the simple left/right political spectrum falls short of accurately describing the various mix of political opinions. There have been several ideas about how to address this problem, the most prominent resulting in the ``Nolan Chart``, which tracks personal and economic freedom along two separate axes. Libertarians often use a short quiz in order to show people where they might fit within this more accurate type of political spectrum. If you have not already done so, click here link to http://www.theadvocates.org/quiz.html and take the quiz for yourself. You may be surprised to see where you fit!   For those of you who score in the Libertarian range, you will find that you're in good company: From television celebrities Drew Carey and Bill Maher, to philosophers Murray Rothbard and Robert Nozick, to U.S. Congressman Ron Paul ; people from all walks of life are proud to call themselves libertarians.  Of course, ours is not the first generation to hold these ideas. The Declaration of Independence, presents what is perhaps the perfect example of the Libertarianism in this country`s history. The Libertarian concepts of self-ownership and mutual respect for each others rights were the ideas that sparked the abolition of slavery, and resonated clearly throughout the civil rights movement.   These are ideas that are just as relevant today as they were then. There are ideas that people still agree with in great numbers. However, too often people are lead to believe that they do not have a choice ; that they must give something up in an attempt to elect ``the lesser of two evils'' but how can being compelled to choose between your ``social`` freedoms and your ``economic`` freedoms be anything but evil?

I need to make some small changes to it but for the most part it's pretty much finished.          Faith the Size of a Mustard Seed Faith is a very important factor in a Christian\u2019s life. Turn to Matthew 17:20 it says this: \u201cAnd Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.\u201d  It\u2019s as simple as it seems, which may not be simple at all. It may seem impossible to you to move a mountain. That is because you don\u2019t have faith. Just having partial faith won\u2019t work but you need to have a full amount of faith. If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, nothing is impossible for you. Mountains will move in your life. Then you\u2019ll move mountains in other people\u2019s lives as well.  Turn to Philippians 4:13 it says this: \u201cI can do all things through Christ which strenghtheneth me.\u201d When you say this statement you have to have faith. If you have God in your life and you have faith all things are possible for you.  Turn to James 2:20 it says this: \u201cBut wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?\u201d Here works is talking about actions. If you have faith that God is alive then put that faith into action by going and spreading the word. An example of this is in James 2:26.  Turn to James 2:26 it says this: \u201cFor as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.\u201d Is your spirit dead? Are you struggling spiritually? Get into God\u2019s word. Trust in Him.  Turn to Mark 16:16-18 it says this: \u201cHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.\u201d  Talk about extreme faith!! God will reward you for your faith but trouble will come if you don\u2019t believe. You will have power if you believe and have faith. You\u2019ll cast demons out of people and they\u2019ll be filled with the Holy Ghost. You will be covered with the blood of Jesus. He will protect you. God will use you as His tool as He heals people. Wouldn\u2019t you like to have that kind of faith and those rewards to follow? The good news is you can! Just believe and have faith.   One of the greatest healing evangelists Kenneth Copeland has ever known came up to him and said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand it. I have prayed for more than 2 million people. I\u2019ve seen all kinds of miracles, but I\u2019m the last guy in the world to ever get healed.\u201d  Just think, that evangelist had seen Jesus face to face more than once. His hand had been set on fire with the healing touch of God, but he couldn\u2019t live on those experiences. He had to learn, just you and I do, to walk one step at a time--speaking, believing and standing on God\u2019s promises in His Word.  \u201cWell, maybe that\u2019s true,\u201d you say, \u201cbut I still think I would have more faith if Jesus would appear to me like He did to that evangelist.\u201d  No, you wouldn\u2019t. Turn to John 20:29 it says this: \u201cBlessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.\u201d  Blessed means  empowered. So, according to Jesus, you\u2019ll have more power if you\u2019ll believe before seeing Him face to face.  Why is that? It\u2019s because for you to believe something you don\u2019t see with your physical eyes, you have to turn inward. You have to see it with your spirit. When you do that, the part of you that is like God rises up and gets stronger.  Am I saying you should avoid seeing miracles?  Absolutely not! Enjoy them all you want. Be a part of what God\u2019s doing, but don\u2019t drop your faith in the process.  First and foremost, keep standing on His promises. His word will work when miracles are happening and when they\u2019re not. His Word will work in the daytime and in the dark. His word will work for anyone who will put it to work\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re 12 or 92. Remember this: Faith\u2014the everyday kind of faith you use for living\u2014doesn\u2019t come from seeing miracles or even seeing Jesus Himself. It comes by Hearing God\u2019s word.  Turn to Romans 10:17 it says this: \u201cSo then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\u201d  Turn to John 20:24-29 it says this: \u201cBut Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said unto him, we have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger and behold my hands; and reach hither they hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.\u201d  It was a command when Jesus said \u201c\u2026be not faithless, but believing.\u201d God wants us to believe and have faith. When you have faith though, put it into action.         "}

Provides central authentication / privilidge levels etc....  But one big problem u face is that when the connectivity to tacacs goes down the router falls back to the default authentication procedure. Many a times you forget the default enable passwords and you are in a fix if the connectivity goes down ....  thats what happened with me :( .  Btw if you wanna know how to get your cisco routers on tacacs please go to :   urlLink http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/480/tacplus.shtml#intro   But the important part is how to break the current password :   Step 1 :  Attach a terminal or PC with terminal emulation to the console port of the router. Use the following terminal settings ( Generally Hyper terminal is used ) : 9600 baud rate No parity 8 data bits 1 stop bit No flow control   Step 2 :  Type   show version   and record the setting of the configuration register. Click here to see output of ashow version command. The configuration register setting is usually 0x2102 or 0x102.   Step 3 :  Reboot the cisco router   Step 4:  Press Break (ctrl + break) on the terminal keyboard within 60 seconds of the powerup to put the router into ROMMON.  Type  confreg    0x2142   at the  rommon 1>  prompt to boot from Flash without loading theConfiguration   Step 5:  Type  reset  at the rommon 2> prompt.

{"id": 209855, "author_id": 4289870, "gender": "female", "age": 14, "topic": "indUnk", "sign": "Gemini", "date": "20,August,2004", "text": "       From the Mind of a Freak   I have no idea why I am typing this, I mean, who cares what a 14-year-old girl thinks about her country and the problems in it. Who cares how a little girl views people? See those ants over there? They\u2019re more than a billion of them, and I\u2019m the one all the way to the right next to the ant carrying the moth. I am just one of billions, and according to the people around me, I\u2019m a scary freak with nothing better to do with life than sit in corners. So now I\u2019m out of the corner, and does anyone really care? Probably not. But I\u2019ll make the best of it.   To start off, I\u2019ll start talking about people in general. They think, \u201cThat person has a black shirt on, they must be bad.\u201d Or \u201cThey don\u2019t believe what I do, they must be evil.\u201d Just because someone does what he or she wants and not what everyone else thinks is \u201cnormal\u201d that doesn\u2019t make him or her a bad person. If you come up to them and say something nice to them, they won\u2019t pounce on you. Come up and bad mouth them, then they\u2019ll fight back. But of course, people are people and they fear difference. Why is that? Because the idea of a perfect \u201csociety\u201d is one where everyone is the same. It will not work, however. You cannot take a group of people and make them all the same; human nature is to rebel against that sort of thing. No one can suppress this nature. So then why do people try to? Why do they bother? Because at the same time, people also have a nature of being scared of other people not like them. Although, some can overcome this nature, more so when someone is older but sometimes he or she cannot get over the fact that not everyone is exactly the same. And they don\u2019t have to be the same.    This is where therapists come in, these professionals tend to try and change someone for the better of the whole. Although, I won\u2019t be so stereotypical as to say all are like that. Some even encourage difference. But some just won\u2019t get off your back. Anything that doesn\u2019t seem right to their perspective must be changed at all costs, doesn\u2019t matter what the person thinks. And if something is wrong, they have a pill for that. Cover up sorrow with a happy pill; people shouldn\u2019t learn to deal with the fact that he or she will be sad at times. Once again, not all are like that, but I can\u2019t help to notice this fact when people talk about mental health and therapy. Therapists are paid to \u201ccare\u201d; I\u2019d rather talk about my problems with someone who cares about me and not their paycheck.    Arrogance is a huge problem as well. All the school kids are laughing at people from other countries. Why? Because they sound funny. What? They sound funny why? Their accents aren\u2019t funny, its just the way they talk, get over it. It\u2019s not a big deal. But the children of our country cannot understand this they are learning to hate. Where are they learning this? From those that do hate. All it takes is one person to hate for someone to copy them and it keeps going like a chain. The hate chain probably will never be broken, but it can be decreased. We have to slow and try to stop a large majority of the arrogance or this country will not flow, the current is already slowing down. If we can\u2019t learn some respect then we cannot unite together because we\u2019d hate whom we\u2019d be uniting with.   Now I\u2019m going to change topic to something more debatable, I\u2019ll start off local with Gay Marriages (I live in MA). Another example of fearing difference, and it\u2019s more of a religious battle than anything else. I really don\u2019t care if that man kissed that other man; it\u2019s not going to kill me. I have worse problems to worry about then marriages. It\u2019s not their fault they\u2019re gay, they didn\u2019t choose it, it\u2019s the way they are. If they could, don\u2019t you think they\u2019d try to act straight? But no, the bible doesn\u2019t like two guys kissing, so lets get this whole country mad about this because we can. Its not as though gay couples are coming out with assault rifles and shooting everyone. Let it go, we have worse problems to deal with. Mind your business.   This also brings up abortion, another religious topic. A baby is a very life-changing occurrence. But the thing is, it\u2019s not my business if a parent decides that they would make a bad parent. If we made abortion illegal, the cloths hangers would come out and more than a fetus would die. Either way, the deed is done, and we already decided to make abortion legal. We are overpopulated as it is, and a fetus is apart of a woman\u2019s body, and they can\u2019t have an abortion if they wait too long because then it\u2019s considered a baby and can feel pain. If the lady doesn\u2019t want to be a mother, let her do what she wants with her body. But if she keeps coming back then sterilize her so she can stop wasting the abortion doctor\u2019s time. Let\u2019s move on and stop worrying about other peoples\u2019 business. The fact is, I don\u2019t care about someone not having a baby. I have better things to worry about then something that has already been decided.    This brings me to politics. I don\u2019t hate Bush; I hate his administration and the CIA for screwing us over. But Bush is a puppet with literacy problems. However, I like what he did in Afghanistan, but then he went to Iraq\u2026what? I thought Bin Laden\u2019s men attacked my country. Saddam was doing his own thing, it may have been bad but we had no business to take over his country. He may have been a horrible leader, but that\u2019s his problem and his peoples\u2019 problem. Or it was. We couldn\u2019t find Bin Laden so we went after the nearest Muslim. Bush\u2019s daddy should have killed Saddam a long time ago, but I\u2019ll give his Father some credit, he probably did send a sniper out who failed. It happens. But we should be finding the guys who hit our country, not someone who may have owned some powerful weapons. Saddam was smart enough not to attack America, so we went over and attacked him. No self-defense, we were just bullies in a playground. If Bush had said, \u201cSaddam is a bad man, lets get \u2018em Johnny!\u201d We would have all shaken our heads and this mess wouldn\u2019t have happened.    And because of 9/11, all these safety measures have been put up on airplanes. Oh yeah, I\u2019m going to take over an airplane with a razor blade. It\u2019ll kill the pilots and I\u2019ll rule the sky. Then I\u2019ll crash into the field of enchanted daisies and kill everyone. \u201cNever sacrifice freedom for security.\u201d My best friend always says that. It\u2019s a quote from one of our founding fathers. A quote long forgotten. This country is hardly free, it has rules and restrictions and laws, so why make it less free? But of course, people have way too much fear; they have to get over the fact that sometimes countries are attacked. It\u2019ll never go away as long as people are here, so don\u2019t bother, just live life as much as possible. We are restricted by our religions, the government and reality, so why restrict it even more with security? Some security is good, but don\u2019t overdo.      Political parties, everyone has them and we\u2019re no different. We have two main parties, Republicans and Democrats. Republicans make the rich richer and the poor poorer (my family is feeling this effect) but at the same time Democrats over tax and get the government too much cash. Both have problems. We shouldn\u2019t even have political parties. It causes hatred between them, we should vote for who we want because of who we want and not the party they are in. We should have listened to George Washington when he warned us against political parties. But we aren\u2019t very good listeners. What can you do? Well, I sit back and watch, I laugh at people hating the other party. It\u2019s just funny how childish both sides are.    Religion is a mouthful for just one word. Look at our constitution, then take the bible and take out God. It\u2019s the same. Religions give us rules and restrictions, as does the government. They walk hand in hand. I have nothing against religion; I just hate how we all must belong to a religion. Why can\u2019t we just believe what we want without having to belong to a group? We use religion to be stereotypical a lot of times. Why organize? Why can\u2019t we just believe a bit of anything we want? Well, we can, but people find that \u201cbad\u201d. Everyone needs a religion right? Everyone must have one. That\u2019s just the way people think.   I\u2019m Agnostic, myself. I get a bad rap because people hate how Agnostics don\u2019t care about how the earth came into existence, and they hate how Agnostics need so much proof to believe. Some ministers, priest, reverends, ect think it\u2019s better to be Atheist because at least most Atheists believe in something even if it\u2019s a scientific belief. But what does it matter? Why should Agnostic even be in existence? Why can\u2019t I just believe what I want without being labeled? The fact is Agnostics are more peaceful than Atheists. Agnostics don\u2019t speak up as much or fight really. And there are so many less Agnostics than Atheists. But people find it disturbing that someone needs solid proof for everything. But Agnostics don\u2019t deny beliefs. They just don\u2019t believe in them, but they won\u2019t deny that those beliefs may be true. Atheists deny, but Atheists speak out more. Atheists, in a sense, fight. Agnostics just sit there and let things happen because they don\u2019t care, people think it\u2019s wrong not to care. The truth is, I really DON\u2019T care, I don\u2019t care if you yell, \u201cGod is the best!\u201d because that\u2019s your opinion, if it makes me uncomfortable then that\u2019s my problem. I can deal with it. I can live with it. I can live with saying \u201cUnder God\u201d when I say the pledge of allegiance (on rare occasions because I don\u2019t like where this country is going.) The only problem I find with it is that the original creator of the pledge didn\u2019t put it in there, but I\u2019ll get over it.   Now, as for Obesity, it\u2019s going to come down to the fact that our government will have to control what we eat because we aren\u2019t strong-willed enough to eat well. We shouldn\u2019t have to go on diets, just make sure we don\u2019t overdo on the high fat, high calorie, and high carbohydrate foods. And we must have some sort of exercise activity. Or at least exercise somewhat. Get yourself moving. I\u2019m being a little hypocritical here because I stay inside all day, but I am planning on obtaining an exercise activity by taking a martial arts class. And I do move around quite a bit when I\u2019m not online. I walk around when listening to music; I do push-ups in the morning or at night. It doesn\u2019t have to be sports to get us moving, just something. But because we all can\u2019t control our urges, we eat \u201clike a dog that feeds until he suffers\u201d (Bad Religion, \u201cHow much is enough?\u201d). We must learn to be strong; we have to in order to stop the predicted future for America, one where 100% of Americans will be obese.   And then there is sex. Sex is overrated. It\u2019s a process of making babies, but all the movies make it seem so great, late night TV is all about it. It\u2019s a natural process let it go people. I don\u2019t care how much fun you have with it, I\u2019m only 14 and it\u2019s all around me. It\u2019s in all the movies, ads, magazines, no wonder there are so many teen pregnancies. People just overdo it so much, and you can even watch it with porn movies. And we\u2019re all taught that it\u2019s wrong to have sex at a young age, yet all around us our movie stars are having it, and stars are idols to many people. It\u2019s hypocritical. You tell us not to but you do. We should stop publicizing sex, stop the porn, and focus on our lives and what we want to do and not what the world around us says is great.   I guess this means I need a conclusion. Well, the conclusion is, this country needs to do some cleaning up. But we just started out we still have time. America has been around for a little more than 200 years. That\u2019s not a lot compared to the thousands of years that Christians claim this world to be, and its really not a lot compared to the billions of years old the scientists claim this world to be. We must watch out, however. We cannot make too many mistakes, and we must continue to realize that the government is not our friend, it is too be feared. Big Brother is watching us all, we must be careful of him. We must be ready to fight him if it becomes necessary. And we must be weary of Patriotism, too much of it can blind us from the mistakes of our country. We have to learn to stay out of other country\u2019s affairs uninvited. And we must concentrate on now; we should stop worrying about how this earth was made and live on it. And we shouldn\u2019t worry about how it\u2019s going to end. Let\u2019s just concentrate on living our lives, because life is short. Death comes fast. But don\u2019t fear death; just meet it when it happens.   Katherine Poliquin 2004            "}
