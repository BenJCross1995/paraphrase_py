Thats way early, For the record, my vacation has been filled with days where Im getting up really early, which after a night of shooting/partying, is really fun, I must say.  So we get over to AUC to meet with the students. We jump in three separate cars and head over to the outskirts of Heliopolis. The plan is really simple: we head to a meeting point where we will meet with Norhans dad, who will then lead the way over to the construction site. If only simple things could remain simple in Egypt.  So we get to our meeting point to wait for Norhans dad. He gets there, and we begin to follow him. Four cars. Norhans dad is leading the way. Well, our driver (an AUC provided driver) decides to pass Norhans dad. Why? I have no idea. Another AUC driver does the same. Now, John and I are riding in the back seat, talking with Jan, who is riding up front. Were not really paying attention to whats going on  were assuming that our driver can do is prescribed job of following the car in front of him.   So about 25 minutes later, the other AUC driver zips up next to us and flags us down, letting us know that weve passed the exit.  (Mighty considerate of him, to do so  otherwise we might end up all the way in Sharm.) So we need to make a U-turn, which is not as simple as it seems because the highways in Egypt arent designed like they are back in the states. The next exit/U-turn is like 10 miles down the road. So we make the U-turn and come back to another exit about another 5 miles beyond the exit that we missed so we can make another U-turn. We do so, get off on the exit, and then stop. We dont see anybody. So we ask the other driver if he saw where everyone went. He didnt. He just saw the exit that he knew we were supposed to get off on, so he flagged us down. This led to about an hours worth of confusion. We call Norhan, who is with her dad, to see if she can give us directions. She cant, because she has no idea where we are. (Oh yeah, did I mention that streets in certain parts of Egypt dont have names? That makes it way easy to figure out where you are.) So we jumped back on the highway, looking for another exit. We literally drove back and forth (in 10 and 5 mile increments) making u-turn after u-turn, trying to get off on the right exit. So it turns out that after we passed everybody, they passed us again and kept going. So we never passed an exit where they had gotten off. We finally made it to the construction site about and hour later (after one of the girls jumped back on the highway, found us and led us back to the site.) Needless to say, Jan was less than pleased with this whole incident, but John and I (partially because of sleep deprivation) thought it was hysterical.   Filming on the construction site was fun. Lets just say that construction standards in Egypt are just a little different than in the US. The girls had a fun time climbing up an inclined plank (not attached to anything) that led from the ground level to the second floor, where the workers were building part of the second floor foundation. Fortunately, a nice breeze kept us relatively cool  it was probably only 100 degrees, but the wind made it feel a little cooler. The lack of humidity helps. I think by this point, I have grown so completely comfortable with sweating profusely that I dont even notice it. We got some really good shots at the site that I think will help show the girls personality. They really have fun in almost any situation. They dont really complain about anything  they just joke about it.   Afterwards, we went over to a caf/restaurant to get some lunch. I ordered a virgin pina colada in the hopes that it would cool me off. It wasnt too good, but it did cool me off. John and I picked up the lunch tab for the class  we figured it was the least we could do for them for letting us follow them around nonstop for two weeks.   John and I came back to the apartment, where we crashed for a bit. Even though it wasnt sweltering at the job site, the sun does have a way of just draining all your energy. Slept just enough to barely refresh ourselves and then headed back to AUC to film a dance performance by Selma. AUC is hosting a Model Arab League and their opening ceremony features some introductory speeches as well as some performances. Selma danced with two other girls to a traditional Egyptian dance track. Out of the three, she was definitely the best dancer  mainly because her on-stage presence was really strong. She really enjoyed the dance. Afterwards I asked her about it, and she explained that she had been dancing for years, but had to quit because AUC stopped offering dance classes and because she couldnt pursue it professionally.  I had wanted to go to the pyramids by night w/ Nahla, but she cancelled. So I stayed in for a bit, then headed out to Cairo Jazz (where at this point I am definitely a regular) to meet up with Yasmin and her mother for some drinks. We bumped into Shirine from Campus over there  she was hangin out with Ammar, one of the owners. There was a live jazz band playing tonight at Cairo Jazz (obvious, you might think, but it is only the second time Ive heard a jazz act here.) The drummer was absolutely incredible. He had a solo pretty much every song, and he totally deserved it. Really solid performance. John and Yasmin know both the lead guitarist/singer and the bassist, and we chat with them a little bit during one of their breaks. Its really true what everyones told me about Cairo  in the upper class circle, everyone knows each other. This has its benefits and its disadvantages. In a society where external pressure and judgment are ever present, I can see how it can be totally annoying to see the same group of people when you go out. At the same time, I think its pretty cool that you can go anywhere, see someone you know on some level and pick up a conversation from where you left it off last week, last month or even last year.

I am not totally ashamed to admit this, because I don't think the lack of information is entirely my fault.  We all know that our state is attacked everyday for our poor education and lack of jobs.  While we usually fare better than dead last on most issues (thank God for Mississippi), our state can most often be spotted near the bottom of any number of rating lists.  Looking beyond the general discourse of crooked politicians and decades under the leadership of one 'Uncle Eddie' Edwards, which has led us down this rutted dirt road of poverty and ignorance, I think this year's election reveals just how low we have all fallen.  When I first realized my oversight, I was appalled.  Here is an election for the highest official in state government and the only candidate I've heard about is Jay Blossman!  I'm an educated individual who reads the news daily -- what must those who are less educated and informed be thinking right now?  Since this time, I have spent several days voraciously searching the Times-Picayune Online for coverage of candidates for governor: who are they, what are their platforms, and what experience can they bring to the office?  I derived this conclusion: I think Forest Gump, or rather the very creative writers of the screenplay, hit upon something: 'Stupid is as stupid does.'  The media coverage of this year's election thus far has been atrocious!  How can we, as Louisiana citizens, expect to improve our state when we can't even gain information about the important issues in our state -- mainly the governor's election?  How are we expected to make informed decisions for the better of our state if we only know the name of our choices?  We are truly the blind being led by the blind, or the devious...  Okay, I realize that the candidates just began qualifiying yesterday, but they have been campaigning before then.  They've all launched websites and begun soliciting donations to their respective campaigns.  They have all developed platforms with the changes they wish to make, but is this information readily accessible to the general public.... NO!  Instead, our politician's literature is filled with the schools they went to and the affiliations they have.  What is this, a race for SGA president or a governor's election?  Today I decided to search all the state newspaper websites until I found some nugget of info on our candidates' platforms.  I began with the Baton Rouge Advocate, assuming that because they were in the capital and closer to the action, they would indeed have extensive coverage.  After all, it's not like the Manships don't own or fund an entire university department, a newspaper, at least five radio stations and a television station; they are bound to have some sort of political connections (Yes, that was sarcasm).  A blurb about a debate for the 2-year community college program and the earth shattering news that Hunt Downer was the first candidate to qualify yesterday was the only info I found (Damn, I can't seem to stop).  Moving on, I next consulted with the Times-Picayune.  I was very skeptical about this venture because of an earlier failed attempt a week or two ago, but things were promising when I actually found an election coverage link.  I was at first afronted with news of the CA race, (it is just SO important to us in LA, isn't it?) but a quick scan provided links to each of the major candidates websites.  I'd finally hit pay dirt... YES!  Other than the list of names, there were no stories, not even the one about qualifying.  So, I've since systematically reviewed each candidates website.  Issues are presented in a variety of ways: from the non-existent and general to the concrete and detailed.  Some candidates assume their audience is grossly uneducated in comparison to themselves, thus addressing their constituants as such.  Others take the time to present their ideas concretely in a manner that can be understood by all.  Ultimately, I think many of our candidates are laughing at us behind our backs.  Why are a vast majority of our citizens uneducated?  Because they are treated that way -- 'Stupid is as stupid does.'  I am scared for this state if every person reacts to the Jay Blossman ad... 'Oh, I know him... I saw his commercial, let's vote for him because I don't know anything about anyone else.'  Blossman's issues came off as extremely lofty and arrogant.  He addressed a large number of issues, including some controversial things like abortion and 2nd amendment rights.  His arguments were trite and obvious in their aim to merely gain the conservative votes of the state.  He is purposely playing the right keys, such the good little politician, to get the votes he needs, not stating issues he actually believes.  I doubt he has the ability or the integrity to lead the state in the direction it needs.  I was impressed with Lt. Governor Kathleen Blanco.  She organized her issues is an excellent manner, going from the general, abstract ideas of education, economic, and healthcare reform to more specific, action plans for each issue.  She most definitely has more experience; she has been second in line for 8 years now.  Her ideas are more realistic than most other candidates because she has a better understanding of the what and how of accomplishing change within state government.  She ultimately has something that every other candidate lacks: womanhood.  Not to sound feminist, but I think now is the time to seek out and elect the female perspective into our governor's office.  Yeah, genderizing isn't exactly PC, but I doubt anyone can argue against the fact that women see things from a different perspective than men.  Not demeaning, just a fact.  What Louisiana needs now is a different perspective, and Kathleen Blanco could provide that.  This view could change in the coming months.  I, for one, plan to keep a very close eye on what's going on in this year's election because it's outcome is integral to the growth and improvement of this state.  I'd like to see this state change, so I (like so many before me) won't be forced to move in search of the bigger and better.         "}

I went to the dojo in the morning to train since I had my driving test in the afternoon (to get a NSW license because I still carry my Brunei license that doesn't have a photo).  The karate day classes are funny; sometimes there'll be heaps of people and like yesterday, there was 3 of us. Not that small classes are a bad thing, but I find they lack the energy of a big group. It also makes it hard for the instructor to conduct a lively class with so few students (in my experience at least). It sure was in stark contrast to the group of 42 girls from Sydney Girls who came in after our class! (They're John's pet project - he approached the school and asked whether they could use a martial arts instructor.) Anyways, these girls elected to do martial arts as a subject and they come into the dojo every monday morning. That is just M-A-D! I wish I got to do martial arts in school... *place big sook here*  When I got back to Penrith and made it to the RTA 20 minutes early for my appointment I got the feeling that something was wrong when I realised they had mis-spelled my surname on the booking sheet. When I brought this to their attention they asked me whether I had a birth certificate on hand because it is procedure to do so when correcting typos or whatever... since I didn't have it handy ('yea sure, I keep it in my back pocket so I can show people now and then') I drove back to get it since I had enough time before my appointment with the testing officer.  When I got back they realised that my current license does not have a date of 1st issue on it (well, I renewed it recently so it was issued last year) and they asked me whether I had my 1st license handy... I mentioned that it had already been copied and was in their system so I didn't need to bring it - to which the answer was, 'Well i'm sure you were told you need to bring back all the identification you brought with you when you booked your license test, which includes your 1st license.' Hello, my ID wasn't even CHECKED when I booked my license test... I felt like kicking up a fuss but the weird feeling in my stomach and the general bad vibe I got in the RTA prevented me from doing so. Besides, I like to consider myself a patient person.  Anyways, the testing officer wasn't too concerned with my documentation because she was concerned with who I was rather than the other nitpicky stuff - she said that stuff could be sorted out later after test. So we do the test and the result when I come back is a... FAIL, because I failed to come to a COMPLETE stop at an indicated stop sign on the road. Having driven for so long, you tend to take shortcuts when you do certain things on the road, such as not come to a complete stop but rather slow the car so that it is inching forwards, which makes it easier to get the damn thing moving again (I drive manuals, sue me) so you don't impede the 10 impatient bastards behind you honking like they're late for work the 5th time this week. Besides, you get good at spotting when there is NO traffic whatsoever. *sigh*  So yes I had to book another license test for $40. I could have used that $40 to buy more shirts. Or at least my groceries for the week. Dammit.  Today was much better though even though I'm still having trouble getting to sleep before 4am - I slept in till almost noon, which gave my body a much needed rest and leisurely got ready to go to training at 6pm. Training today was pretty good - I always enjoy kickboxing classes because I don't feel the pressure that comes with wearing a belt in karate. No one really minds if you're not giving 110% during class and you don't have the army-style discipline in karate that a lot of the pressure comes from (unless Shihan takes a kickboxing class, but that's a rarity these days).  My usual partner during kickboxing is Martin, who's been teasing me lately about fighting John Halford a lot. Now you see, John Halford is an AWESOME karateka and kickboxer - he's never lost to another Australian in karate competition and his record is like 80 wins, 3 losses. I'm not sure about his kickboxing record, but he does hold a world title in some category under some organisation. He was fighting in the Nationals where I fought at last year and was in the open middleweight (brown / black belts), which he won for the 6th straight year, and I was in intermediate middleweight (yellow / green belts). I've since graded to brown belt in December and it doesn't take a genius to figure out whose division I'm in this year.  The stuff he (Martin) says is quite amusing really. After I had gone through a sequence of some 160 kicks (blame Tony, our trainer), he said, 'That's it, Joel! John Halford's shaking in his boots now!'  After class, Hector (who's Cuban and an Olympic judoka) decided to grapple a little with me - now I've only grappled in my life once before, and that was with Amir, who's Iranian and has been wrestling since he could barely walk. Obviously, Amir smacked me around on the mat that day, but I still managed to hold a bit of my own. Anyways, Amir and Hector grappled one day and he made Amir tap like a typewriter, or so I hear since I didn't witness it. Amir himself told me Hector was trying to kill him. (You tap out in wrestling / grappling when someone has you in a hold and you can't get out of it - it's usually accompanied by a lot of pain when force is applied!)  I don't really know how to describe Hector - he's not very tall but he is a walking heap of muscle, his upper body would put most bodybuilders to shame. Think Ken Shamrock people... (http://www.webcom.com/collectr/wr/images/wpshamrockk.jpg) but bigger! So yes he's strong, but this guy has got impeccable technique. I swear he was wiping the floor with me but without using any strength. He's quick as hell too, I squirmed out of some of his holds but he'd just have me in another one before I could think! He nearly choked me out on the last one too. *cough cough* I should seriously start learning some stuff off this guy...  Yes I feel good now after training; maybe it's the endorphin rush, maybe it's the fact I survived Hector, but I guess there really is nothing like a good training session to make the world alright again. :)             "}

I'd like to be there right now. I'm supposed to be working right now, i feel really bad about that, i had to call in and tell them i had a little family obligation, brothers birthday and all, he seemed pretty let down. i hope he still wants me back on monday, i feel very tempremental at the moment. of course there is no family obligation, i'm just sitting in my room wishing i was out. i could easily go out right now, it's only 6, sunday curfew is 9, i think. but i'm pretty sure i've got some homework to be doing. maybe i'll go for a walk to the park on 20th and vermont. i used to go there when things were going badly.   i remember one night in particular, it was about 10, or maybe later. i was withering away in my house, i was starting to realize things would never be the same, i only saw the bad in that, in change. so i put on my suede jacket with white cuffs, grabbed my phone and sketchbook, and went for a long walk to that park. i talked to casey for a long time, i'm pretty sure i was crying while i was talking. this whole event has partially faded in my mind now, it took me almost ten minutes just to remember why i was so upset that night. i do remember now, it was about kevie and kristin, swanky times.   I always associate people with songs, i associate everything with songs. someone i new recently pointed this out to me. they always happened to start singing, or just mentioning songs i had particuarily strong feelings towards. like 'brown eyed girl' the song by van morrison. my dad used to sing that to me all the time when i was little, i remember him with that song. Oh, not to go on another tangent, but once i've started thinking about something i go with it. there was another wong that i always associate with my dad. 'under the boardwalk' i think it's by the drifters but i can't quite remember. when i was little i had a loft in my room. it was really justa bunck bed without a bed on teh bottem. my dad built it for me when i was 4, it was a birthday present of sorts. anyway, i remember many nights, i'd lay up against the bars keeping me from rolling off and listen to me dad sing that song to get me to fall asleep (have i always had sleeping problems?) he'd stand there, he was very tall. but was sparked the tangent was that one day i was with some friends of mine, we were waiting on line to go on a ferris wheel in golden gate park. it was pretty foggy out that day. they were singing it, i politely asked them to stop, they didn't so i asked again. i was being forceful, i'm generally pretty passive with everything, so they asked why. this was last summer by the way. i told them that the song was sacred (i really did say sacred, strange huh?) and that i'd feel better if they wouldn't sing it. i just got that look. they knew what had happened with my dad, but they didn't like to talk about it with me much, so they just changed the subject. sometimes i wish i had talked more about it when everything happened, but that's how life works.  Now i forgot why i started writting here, i hate how i distract myself so much with this writting. oh right, music association. um, i don't remember what i was going to say about that.   I haven't told many people about this plan yet, mainly because i've only just started formulating it. i'm planning to change my room around a bit. if you've never seen my room it's painted mango, i chose the colour in 8th grade, i still love it dearly. i honestly couldn't imagine my room any other colour. on a side note, my room is the only room in my entire house that is not painted white, i think that says a lot about how i fit in with my family. anyway, my plans. i was thinking about putting a wire from one end to my room to the other, high up, the long way around. then, buying sheer purple fabric, the semi see through stuff and pinning it to either side of my room and hanging it over the wire to create a purple apearing ceiling. then, once that's compleated, i'm going to buy lanturns, the chinese ones in bright colours, i was thinking red, but red has been a fantasy of mine for two years now. i originally wanted to get the kind of lanturns with light inside of them, but that is way to complex for me, and probably too heavy for the wire that i'm going to hang them on. i'm going to do this all in one day over the summer while my mom is out at work, i think if she was here while i was putting it up she'd discourage me and not let me do it. but once it's all up i think she'll let me keep it. and if she doesn't i'll keep it up anyway, just like me christmas lights designated for the summer only. i've been putting this plan off for about a month now, mainly because i haven't had more than 20 dollars in my wallet at any given time, i think this project will be costly. but i just got money for my confirmation, so i'm going to try and save it and make this project work.  i'm not really sure why i just rambled on about what i'm going to do to my room, i'm guessing this is dreafully boring. i'm painting fantasy senarios in my head right now.  max just came in here to fart. i swear he'll never grow up, but i love him all the same. it's become part of his game, i guess it's the one he plays in his head because i'm not a player, more like the victem. he likes to come in here fart, scream 'safety' and run off in a fit of giggles. I normally don't mind all that much, except sometimes whne i'm in one of my painting vortexs i don't hear him sneaking up, normally the music is fairly loud as well. i'll never admit it but sometimes he really does scare me when he sneaks up.   my mom took us round the backyard earlier today, we were both dressed up max and i. I was in my lovely brown dress which i got to wear to my confirmation, really confirmation was an excuse to get myself a nice dress. so i was all dressed up, and little maxy was in black suit minus the tie. babsy kept trying to take photos of us and we kept goofing off. i really wanted to get connie in one of the pictures but 'she'll muss up your dress' with a long sigh i said okay and pretended to pose, only to stick my touge out at the last moment. 'allyson.... (she said with and emphasis) stop goofing off, i want to send these pictures to the grandparents' i sure one of the pictures will turn out okay. after she took about ten she asked me if i left the light meter set correctly. i just gave her a funny look started singing. max and i did the tango all over the lawn, it was pretty comical. i think i'm going to miss maxy when i go off to college, i'll have no one to interupt me, or to stay home with me when i don't feel like going out. everyone once in awhile, maybe every 2 months i have a max appreciation day where i take max where ever he wants and let him have whatever he wants. it's my way of spending time with him and showing him that i love him. i normally take him to the movies, or last time he really wanted to go to in and out burger, so we did that and played air hockey. normally when i tell people about my 'max appreciation days' they say they're sorry i have to spend the day doing what he wants, i don't think they understand  that i choose to do that, even babsy was caught off gaurd the first time i did that. it's nice to spend the day with maxy every once in a while. it's like being a kid again.  i just found my membership card to the legion of honor and the de young museum. i'm pretty sure it expired last month, which means i'll need to renew it. i really want to see the art deco exhibit at the legion of honor. but it's a drag getting to the museum, but i guess it wont be so hard when i have my license. i'm thinking about joining MOMA as well, i used to have some kind of membership there abouta year or two ago. i'd go there on rainy days after school and sketch differnt exhibits. back when i was really passionate about my artwork, i'm starting to get that way again. if anyone wants to go to either museums with me let me know, we'll make a day out if it.  i was reading something online earlier about treasure hunts. i remember in 8th grade i planned a huge treasure hunt in my neighborhood for my birthday. but then the actual day turned out to be 97 degrees out with is a huge rareity for san francisco so i decided i wasn't going to make my friends climb around my hill for an hour in the heat. but i want to have a real treasure hunt soon, during the summer before i go off to art school. i'll need to get a few other people involved in planning it, it can be a city wide search ending... who knows, somewhere nice. treasure hunts are fantastically fun, but only if everyone else is into it as well, i guess i'll have to ask around and see who's interested.    ENOUGH!           "}

Although time goes in one direction, it is truly elastic, expanding&nbsp; to too much when it is not needed (say in a dentist's chair, or worse, in a meeting), and contracting to too little when you really want it (when was that report due?).  Time for me is a rubberband, and occasionaly it ricochets out of control off the floor, the ceiling, and the nearest human body (the cats have the common sense to get out of the way).  To sum up in a hopefully painless way, work has kept me busy, my mother has kept me busy, and my cats have made it clear that the bed I sleep in is actually theirs, and that I'm just borrowing space they'd rather not give up.  Working at the YMCA has been enjoyable, interesting, and far from boring. Between phones, the computer, and checking in members while handing out towels, I'm learning to multi-task like a five-ring circus with the occasional rampant lion or elephant. You see, if there's one thing I've learned is that people on the whole, or at least those at the Y, are genrally good, patient, and if they've got a problem or a complaint then they say so in a civil manner and that's that. Then there's the occasional lion-elephant, and even then those creatures are more docile than these&nbsp;two members whose tempers exploded this past week.  Let me start by saying that at the front desk of the YMCA, the people who work there are pretty much the communication center of the building, but they are not the ones who make the decisions in regards to how the building and programs are run. That is for the administration to do, simple as that. So when there's a problem with the placement of the equipment in the fitness center, or some machine isn't working right, then we pass the information on to the appropriate person and they address those particular issues.&nbsp; Almost all the members at the Y seem to understand this, except for a couple, who if they do understand it, completly ignore it and rant like ill-mannered three-year-olds throwing a temper-tantrum because they can't get what they want.  Interestingly enough, those ill-mannered three-year-olds throwing temper tantrums of late have been&nbsp;grown adult men, of which only one I have faced, and thankfully someone else was there to intercept him.  Look, it is one thing to air ones grievences, to say that there's a problem and give suggestions as to how you'd like it fixed, especially asking if there is a particular person you need to talk to about it.&nbsp;It is another thing to rant, rave, and attack people who aren't even there, let alone a whole body of people. It's even worse when it's done to people who have no control over the situation let alone any say.  Just last Wednesday (and I was thankfully not there for this) a man came in at 6 p.m. wanting a basketball. One of the ladies behind the service counter informed him that the gym was currently in use by the Wednesday Basketball League, and that the entire court was being used until 10 p.m. that night. And so she warned him as she went to get him a basketball&nbsp;that he might not get a chance to play. Oh, the man threw a fit spouting that he was a doctor and a member and that he knew the head of the company whose name graced our building&nbsp;(which, although it's the name of our building, it only means that they sponsored the building of it), and that he wanted a basketball, that we weren't giving him one, and he kept repeating that he was a doctor and a memeber like it would get him special treatment or that he was far more intelligent than the people behind the desk.&nbsp; After about twenty minutes of this tirade, he went on down to the gym, and as one of the managers (and administrator) put it shot off a couple of 'granny-shots' for a few minutes until the league nudge him off. And it didn't stop there, he called up to the desk from the lockerroom demanding to speak to the manager, as that the manager, a woman, had answered, she said that she was indeed the manager. No, he said, he wanted to speak to the manager, he wanted to speak to the man. The only man on duty that night, a really laid-back guy by the name of 'Tom,' was handed the phone, the poor guy, and heard a whole rant on how the doctor had been fond of basketball and playing basketball since he was a small child, and how just holding the basketball would allow him to learn things and that the women up at the front desk were loathe to give him a basketball. As the doctor left, he grabbed a piece of paper, wrote down everyone's name including the manager (whose first name he kept mispronouncing), and even asked Tom's name, who looked at the guy and asked 'What did I do?' since he had not been in the middle of all of this. Then the doctor stormed out.  Well, Dr. Pang has no doubt already received his letter from the head of Membership Services saying that although we are there to serve his needs and help him, we are not there to take that kind of behaviour, and that such abuse is unacceptable. Oh, yes, and there were witnesses to his tirade to say the least. One fellow was sitting at a table in the lobby just shaking with quiet laughter, while a newly married couple asked the doctor's name (after he had gone down to the locker rooms) so that they knew who they absolutely didn't want as their physician in any aspect.  Yesterday, and I thank heavens for having the co-workers I have, a fellow came in at 9 a.m. asking why there couldn't be any pool lanes open at that hour (there are swim lessons and water aerobics at that hour attended by our senior citizens and our youngest members with their parents), and he went on ranting about how he spent so much money for a family membership and that his son couldn't go down to play basketball during the day because the day-camp took over the gym until 6 p.m. To leave it at that would have been one thing, but then he added something rather intolerable. He went on to rant, 'What is the&nbsp;YMCA doing, trying to squeeze out every last dollar possible? They're turning this building into a nursery. Meanwhile, his son was out playing basketball in the 100 degree heat.' At that point he wasn't there to rant or complain, he was there saying 'Me! Me! Me! I want! I want! I want!' and&nbsp;he was getting absolutely no sympathy or understanding from me. Frankly, I was about ready to tell him that if he felt that the membership was not suiting his needs that he could cancel his membership, and if he had bought the full year package we would gladly refund the balance.  As I said before, thankfully my more experienced co-worker was there as that she partially placated the man, as if he could be placated, as he walked through the doors into the main part of the facility (where he was going, I don't know, as that he felt he couldn't swim).&nbsp; We were going to have him speak to the manager on duty, but I don't know if this ever happened as that we were supposed to snag him on the way out. Hopefully my co-worker saw him leave and got him as that I didn't.  Other than that, I really enjoy seeing members come in. The children of all ages are an absolute hoot, lots of energy and lots of fun. Our senior citizens, whom I enjoy calling 'silver foxes' are people I greatly admire. They have so much energy, so much spunk, even our 90-somethings! A few of them look so frail, but they are up and moving, and getting out to socialize and all that, things that my grandfather didn't do.  A side note here as I write, if I seem to be meandering off it's only because I'm being talked at by my significant other who has a gift of rambling like a brooke in flood. I love him, but he doesn't quite understand that I can't hold a discussion very well while I'm trying to write (which gets rather infuriating if I'm trying to do another entry for the story/novel/series/tome I'm co-writing).  Right, so, my mother's now moved into her new (to her) home out in the 'country,' nearly half-way between St. Louis and Hannibal (or at least somewhere on the way). I spent days earlier this month packing, and got off work early to help out with the movers to take stuff from the house and put it into one of the four storage lockers she had rented; she had to move out by the 12th, but the new house wasn't ready until the 20th. And again, I helped her, the eight movers with the four vans, move from the four lockers to her new home on the 21st.  I've got to say this, I'm already nestling comfortably into the thought that the new house in Moscow Mills is now the family home, and some place I can live should the need arise.   Now I've just finished being told the events for the entire last episode of  Stargate: Atlantis , although I never asked for the information.  Anyhow, back to my mother's new home. It's a 10 acre plot of land with a two-storey house with a finished basement making it a total of five bedrooms, three baths, an office area, a large kitchen, dining room, living room/sunroom, family room, and a storage room. There's an above-ground pool in the backyard, a playhouse for the kids, and two small storage sheds. There's also sotrage space in the attic which is sorely needed considering all of the stuff moved. Note: this is a combination of my things, my mother's things, and things inherited/received after my grandparents' deaths. The neighbor on the left has two horses, the neighbor through the woods on the right breeds and raises dogs, and my mother's going to raise alpaca's and use their wool.  Oh, yes, and there's a small cemetary at the back of the property. Unfortunately, the grove that its in has become overgrown, and I can only see one pillar-type burial marker, but only from a distance at which I can't read it. Although some folks would possibly get creeped-out by this, for me (and my mother too, I think) and my sister it's a sign that this is a good land, and that we're blessed to have the privilage to care for the burial ground. Yes, while some would think of ghosts as being bad things, we consider it good. And a small cemetary means that whomever was buried there had lived there, and that they were so well loved that they were buried close to home. That's the important word 'home.'   Speaking of which, I need to get myself together and head out that way with Lloyd. Although my mother's sleeping at the moment (she works night shift as a nurse at a local hospital), I had told her that I'd be coming out this weekend to mow the property because it needs it badly! That and I'm kind of hoping that I can get a picture of the cemetary, and&nbsp;start making plans on how to clear it out enough undergrowth to tend to it properly, and keep the wildflowers!  I know it sounds strange, but when my mother told me about the cemetary, I went straight out to see it (of course! I am the curious one after all). She said it was fenced in, but I found that the fence was only on one side, and that there was a cut pathway around the back (someone had mowed a path for the surveyors a couple of weeks ago). Aside from seeing the single-pillar stone (kind of like an obelisk), I saw a number of wildflowers and a huge black and gold butterfly. It also struck me as to how sweet the air smelled. It was absolutely delightful.  Now, if only I can keep journalling daily. I shall endevour to make it my goal to do so.  "}

I decided to type a few things that people in this world do that just make you want to shake your head...I would like to dedicate this website to that hungry fella on the trainthe other day(whose that? Just read) So I had to catch the train yet again the other day to go ball....getting on the train for me happens pretty often; I have seen some messed up people on the train so it takes a pretty strange person to actually catch me off guard. Anyways where I get on the train is the last stop on the orange line which means that their are many times when you are actually on the train and waiting for it to leave the station. This means that after you pay your token you have to go down what looks like a good hundreds of millions of stairs to reach the track without missing the train.  To help you figure out what speed you need to attack the stairs to catch the train the good old train system rings this obnoxious bell to let you know the doors are about to close(I have yet to figure out exactly how much time you have after the bells rings..because I have definitely gotten left a few times..thats always a hard situation to play off ).  I don't care who you are, anyone that has taken the train or even the bus before has felt cheap fighting between breaking a sweat running to your stop or just decided to wait for the next train or bus to come and get left. It is always the best satisfaction when you are in a rush and you catch that train/bus right before it is about to leave, however it is the worst feeling when you pick up your stroll or slight jog down the stairs just to be a step behind and watch all eyes on you as the train/bus passes you by (however you know I've mastered how to play that off ..haha).   I must admit their is a feeling of satisfaction when you are on the train looking at all the people who took their time thinking they were going to make the train and just miss by seconds....the face is pricelss and always gives me a little chuckle....except when people who are running after the bell has rung, who really don't get that hint (that you usually get once you hit that last flight of stairs from the track) that your ass is not going to make it and practically run right into the doors fighting for that last second ...I actually felt really bad for this poor lady who I saw booking down the stairs like her life depended on it and just when she was supposed to realize she was a step too slow ..well she didn't and ran right into the doors as they closed! If their was a sound affect that could best describe what her face did against the doors it would be S-M-O-O-S-H!It was an instance where you wanted to laugh but then feel really bad for her at the same time....Just makes me want to shake my head  So I'm on the train, getting comfortable b/c I have several stops before I get off and this noise is irritating the hell out of me....I look diagonal from me and a grown man (late 20's early 30's) is straight tearing up this mango. The way he was dogging that mango was not human at all! I mean brotha man was on some wolverine type status..I mean this man had a full out right off the tree mango that he was just taking bites out ..once in a while he would spit in this plastic bag but this man was going all out with sloppy noises and all ...what I should of done was ask him if he perfers 'spit or swallow' haha   Anyway I will be honest I thought it was absolutely disgusting how he was attacking his fruit like it was alive but for some reason I couldn't stop staring at him tearing up his mango...was I slightly attracted to the way he was putting so much attention to that mango.... who knows(I mean he was basically making loving to this piece of fruit with sighs and all)...I don't know but I'm sure I looked just as crazy the few times he actually looked up and caught me watching him tear up this piece of fruit...it was comedy! So after fruit man has finished his mango (3 min. flat no lie) he takes his napkin out and takes a breath which leads me to finally look away until by my surprise, I'm a hearing yet another noise from his direction. Not a minute later he has already pulled out a plum that I swear he took close to 3 bites of and it was gone...right now I'm just amazed like damn thats a hungry ass dude! I have never seen someone swallow so much fruit in such a short period of time.  He finishes the plum and pulls out another one out of his bag...I mean damn! He had so much fruit he could of just setup a fruit stand on the train.  Shit just makes me shake my head  Another thing I see on the train alot is men crossing their legs...now why do you guys do this??? Does that feel natural?? What do other guys think when they see another guy cross their legs? You rarely see a brotha with like baggy jeans and a white T cross their legs so I'm thinking its only accepted for certain people? or maybe when your dressed up? Is it o.k. for some people to do it and not others..for ex. Ahmad Rashad who does it alot on t.v. It for some reason always makes me shake my head more so in disbelief that that position is at all comfortable ...for any guys reading this please testify to this or explain in the comment box below I really would like to know.  Just another comment to those brothas out there....us females do understand that not everyone has money to wear the clothes they want and you are only left with the option to work with the gear you have which is fine...but who in the hell said that a hooded sweater cut into a tank top and a leather hat was going to make you look cool...yes I did see this on the train and the dude had the nerve to look at almost all the ladies on the train up and down as if he was wearing the new Roca Wear or Sean John...just makes you want to shake your head...  O.k last but not least just make me want to shake my head situation that I saw recently. I'm in a salon getting 'my hair did'.  Typical black hair salon with ladies gossiping, music playing everyone talking and laughing but it all comes to a hault when the door opens and we see this lady who I would have to say was at least 40 something come through.  The whole salon goes silent the more this lady continues to walk in the salon.  Her weave was probably 2 yrs old if I had to guess, her hooded sweater was so tight it was more of a tank top that was rising on her back barely covering half of it...her grammy draws were so high they basically met the back of her sweater and her jeans were sagging below her waist with her zipper undone...her sneakers? who knows I couldn't even get that far without shaking my head with disbelief. After she walked her pigeoned toed self into the middle of the salon and sat at the corner of this chair she asked with the worst wino voice you want to imagine, if she could use the bathroom. It was a shame..of course she was told that they didn't have a public bathroom and that it was occupied anyway..basically to give her the hint that it was time to get the FUCK OUT!Hahaha But as she left she probably got the last laugh...yes this grown ass woman straight peed on the corner of her chair as she left..straight nasty and defintiely couldn't make you do anything else but make you want to shake your head.  Thats all for now B EZ you all      "}

Breen  11/18/2002, Volume 008, Issue 10   Every Midget Has an Uncle Sam Costume  Writing for a Living  by Donald Bain  Barricade, 239 pp., $22.95   Murder at Ford's Theatre  by Margaret Truman  Ballantine, 326 pp., $24.95   A BIZARRE PHENOMENON first observed in the 1940s became a crime-fiction epidemic by the 1990s. Famous entertainers, athletes, and presidential relatives began sitting down at the typewriter to bang out mystery novels.   Or so they would have us believe. In truth, nearly every one of those celebrities made a deal through an agent or book packager, collected a nice advance for the use of the name, and left to a professional ghostwriter all the actual writing.   Ghostwriting is a time-honored practice, and most readers surely realize that movie stars and baseball players have help with their memoirs--just as all politicians these days have help with their speeches, campaign literature, and policy statements. But the dissemination of novels that are ghostwritten seems somehow more blatantly deceptive and ethically questionable.   Look, for example, at the new memoir by the veteran ghostwriter Donald Bain, who has written, under his name or others, some eighty books. In 'Every Midget Has an Uncle Sam Costume,' Bain entertainingly describes his experiences as an officer in charge of censoring American Armed Forces Television in Saudi Arabia, as a jazz musician, and as an airline public-relations flack in a happier and more free-wheeling era of air travel.   But the most intriguing topic in the book is ghostwriting. Bain's first major success, 'Coffee, Tea, or Me?' (1967), presented the comical amatory adventures of two stewardesses who appeared in public as the authors, Trudy Baker and Rachel Jones. Three sequels followed, plus similar faux first-person accounts of nurses, office temps, teachers, and actresses, always with attractive young women recruited to front the books for publicity purposes. Bain also wrote the autobiography of actress Veronica Lake, crime fiction signed by the actor David Toma and the ex-cops Nick Vasile and Mike Lundy, and the 'Murder, She Wrote' novels in ostensible collaboration with 'Jessica Fletcher,' the fictional character played on television by Angela Lansbury.   There's no doubt that readers can be extraordinarily naive. About the cover photos on the 'Murder, She Wrote' books, Bain reports, one fan wrote in to say it was 'amazing how much Angela Lansbury looked like Jessica Fletcher.' But when the ostensible author is a real person--and the book itself is a novel--readers don't seem unreasonable in expecting that the person whose name appears on the cover actually wrote the book.   Employing a ghostwriter on a work of fiction is never more dubious than when the putative author really is a writer. Brett Halliday (creator of Mike Shayne), Leslie Charteris (creator of the Saint), and Ernest Tidyman (creator of Shaft) all turned to ghosts to carry on the exploits of their famous characters. The Ellery Queen team employed other writers to turn out paperbacks that were very different from the genuine Queen novels. One case of posthumous ghosting, 'Chains of Command' (1999)--credited on the cover to William Caunitz, who died in 1996, but written almost entirely by Christopher Newman--precipitated a class-action suit by readers who believed they had been defrauded.   Celebrity mystery novels, like other ghostwritten books, differ in the way the actual writer is or is not credited. In the most honest method, arguably not ghostwriting at all, the celebrity makes the writing professional a full collaborator, as in the recent 'Blue Moon,' signed in equal-sized print by bandleader Peter Duchin and Edgar Award-winning novelist John Morgan Wilson.   The second method doesn't admit the ghostwriter's existence to the world at large but at least tips off others in the writing and publishing trade. Many of the novels attributed to 'Star Trek''s William Shatner credit in the acknowledgments the assistance of science-fiction humorist Ron Goulart. Actor George Kennedy's paperback mysteries offer thanks to Walter J. Sheldon. A more subtle variation is to dedicate the book to the real author, as actor George Sanders did for Craig Rice and Leigh Brackett, the authors of the two 1940s crime novels published under his name. (Bain used the same method to give himself credit on the 'Coffee, Tea, or Me?' books.)   The third method is for the celebrity mystery to eschew the slightest hint of a ghostwriter's presence. Great pains were taken to suggest that the earliest successful example of a celebrity mystery novel, Gypsy Rose Lee's 'The G-String Murders' (1941), was the stripper's own work, though it has long been attributed to Craig Rice. The opera singer Helen Traubel's 'The Metropolitan Opera Murders' (1951) was actually the work of Harold Q. Masur. Though the television personality and show-business all-rounder Steve Allen had a legitimate track record as a writer, his mystery novels of the 1980s and 1990s were all ghostwritten, first by Walter J. Sheldon and then by Robert Westbrook.   PERHAPS THE MOST CURIOUS subgenre of recent decades is the mystery novel written by the children of presidents. You can see neatly represented in them the three methods of dealing with a ghostwriter. The most recent to enter the field, Susan Ford, credits a co-author, Laura Hayden, for this year's 'Double Exposure: A First Daughter Mystery.'   Elliott Roosevelt, whose first novel featuring his mother Eleanor as sleuth was 'Murder and the First Lady' (1984), didn't offer a shared byline but gave his ghostwriter a nod via a note in his early books, crediting William Harrington as 'my mentor in the craft of mystery writing [who] has given me invaluable assistance with the First Lady mysteries.' After Elliott Roosevelt died in 1990, his publishers added to his jacket biography for 'A First Class Murder' (1991) the claim: 'A hard-working and prolific writer, he left behind a number of already-completed Eleanor Roosevelt mysteries.'   By 1998's 'Murder in the Map Room,' they were still touting 'a number of unpublished manuscripts to be enjoyed by readers in the years to come.' (A Booklist reviewer dryly noted that Roosevelt had become 'one of the mystery genre's most prolific dead authors.') Harrington, ironically, would finally be credited as the author of a Roosevelt book, 'Murder at the President's Door' (2001), only after his own death.   Margaret Truman, the longest running and most commercially successful of the presidential offspring fronting mysteries, offers no hint in any of her books, beginning with 'Murder in the White House' (1980), that she has a ghostwriter, a collaborator, or even a literary mentor. Her 'Capital Crimes' novels, which usually use as background Washington, D.C., landmarks (the Kennedy Center, the National Cathedral, the Pentagon, the National Gallery, the Library of Congress, etc.), provide plenty of historical tidbits and tourist information. They are far from distinguished detective fiction, but they do rank as above-average celebrity mysteries.   The latest, 'Murder at Ford's Theatre,' is soundly crafted and professionally paced. The headline-inspired plot concerns the murder of a senatorial intern evocatively named Nadia Zarinski. The stock characterizations sound like casting notes, but at least it's easy to tell the people apart. The author employs familiar strategies to puff up the page count: potted biographies of characters and repetitious dialogue (as when the cops report to their superior investigative details that are still fresh in the reader's mind). Truman's amateur sleuthing team of law professor Mackensie Smith and his gallery-owner wife Annabel are sometimes likened by generous reviewers to Nick and Nora Charles. They share the stage with an odd-couple police team, a Jewish detective who's also a Lincoln buff and his African-American partner.   The writing is usually efficient but flavorless. Occasionally--in the deadly combination of authorial haste and editorial sloppiness typical these days of books considered to have a ready-made readership--it descends into clunky archaism ('Klayman had proved his mettle on more than one occasion, facing down dangerous situations with steely resolve and audacious fearlessness'), clumsy genre references ('The strange case of the murdering midget. Sounds like a Holmes novel'), ponderous banality ('Sunday, as everyone knows, is a day of rest, except for those in jobs demanding their presence'), and faulty syntax ('Seemingly social brunches offer both eggs Benedict as well as the scrambled eggs of negotiation').   ARBOR HOUSE'S Donald Fine, Truman's publisher at the time of her first mystery, swore she had no ghostwriter, but there was a clue from the beginning: Though widely and favorably reviewed, the novel was not nominated for the Edgar Award for best first novel by an American author, nor, according to Allen J. Hubin, a member of the committee, was it even submitted by the publisher.   Hubin's 'Crime Fiction III: A Comprehensive Bibliography, 1749-1995,' the most authoritative source on mystery authorship, identifies Donald Bain as Margaret Truman's ghostwriter, based on intelligence from reliable publishing community sources. Bain has flatly denied it, both to Hubin and in an e-mail to me: 'I do not ghostwrite Margaret Truman's murder mysteries.'   But what does Bain's autobiography have to say? A note at the end of 'Every Midget Has an Uncle Sam Costume' claims that 'contractual obligations prohibit Donald Bain from publicly taking credit for an additional twenty novels.' Elsewhere in the book, he partially contradicts this, writing that 'some of my best work appears in an eighteen-book series ghostwritten over the past twenty years for a well-known person. It would be professionally inappropriate for me to take public credit for this series, although I'm not under contractual obligation to conceal my involvement.' ('Murder at Ford's Theatre' brings the total of Truman's novels to nineteen.) Obligatory or not, Bain's denial fulfills his duty as an honorable ghostwriter. In the same chapter, he excoriates, for ghostwriting unprofessionalism, Lucianne Goldberg, who publicly claimed credit for the novel 'Washington Wives' (1987) out of anger over putative author Maureen Dean's interviews.   IF BAIN IS Truman's ghost, he won't admit it, but he provides enough clues to support a strong circumstantial case. He states his involvement with the series 'for a well-known person' began in 1980 and continues, 'I've been writing novels in this series ever since, a book a year, most of them well reviewed and appearing on many bestseller lists throughout the country.' How many other candidates for a frequently bestselling book-a-year mystery series beginning around 1980 are there?   Bain writes that he disagreed with a young editor over 'a husband-and-wife team of characters [created] for a book in a series I was ghosting. My characters were in their fifties, erudite, physically fit, and madly in love.' Though the editor thought them too old, 'The characters stayed and went on to become particular favorites of critics and readers of the series.' That sounds very much like Margaret Truman's Mackensie and Annabel Smith. In researching the coffee-table book 'Caviar, Caviar, Caviar' (1981), Bain learned of the underground trade in Iranian caviar, smuggled into the United States via Copenhagen. He writes, 'I later used what I'd learned as the basis for a crime novel I went on to ghost for a well-known person.' The plot of Truman's 'Murder on Embassy Row' (1984) involves caviar smuggling.   Recognizing that the ghosting of fiction presents a greater ethical dilemma than nonfiction, Bain asks, 'Is a book buyer cheated when buying a novel not written by the person whose name appears on the cover? Is it fraud? I don't think so, though my bias is understandable.' Perhaps his bias is, in fact, understandable--but he goes on to add: 'In most cases, the consumer gets a lot better book than if the nonwriting collaborator had tried to do it solo.' This will not do. The book is sold on the premise that a celebrity wrote it, and there is no excuse for such a pretense other than deceiving the consumer.   Still, one might ask, where's the harm? The journeymen writers doing the actual work undoubtedly realize more profit from being celebrity ghostwriters than they could from novels under their own names. The idea that the inflated money the celebrity and ghostwriter get would otherwise go to more deserving but less famous professional writers is clearly specious. The deceptiveness of attributing a book to a person who didn't write it is minor next to the credits for doing nothing that feature in many major motion pictures. And what does the deceived reader care, if the novel is a good read that appears to draw on the celebrity's area of expertise?    THE ANSWER IS that there are several harms. The books, more even than most commercial fiction driven by the marketplace rather than the artistic impulse, are rarely good mystery fiction. The celebrity publicity machine attracts readers that might otherwise be drawn to better books. While the big advance might not have gone elsewhere, some of the bookstore display space, public-library buying, and newspaper review attention certainly would. The public impression that anybody can write a book erodes the professional respect accorded to real writers. And finally, in the unlikely event a celebrity author actually writes a novel, no one in the cynical book world will believe it.   Bain writes, 'I'm often asked when talking to groups about my career: 'How can you stand to see someone else's name on a book that you've written?'' He finds it easy to answer: He makes a good living writing for others, and he takes pride in doing the best work he can on every project. Most professional writers would agree. Writing is such a hard way to make a living, it's tough to blame the ghostwriter for going where the money is.   The parallel question for celebrity novelists is, 'How can you stand to see your name on a book somebody else wrote?' That should be harder to answer, but, sadly, it probably isn't.

I may be half crazy, but I loved it there.  The drive to and from was so great that the bad cell phone reception didn't even bother me!  This was one of the most peaceful weekends I've had in ages.    To start off, I got to Austin somewhat late Friday night.  Of course, there was plenty of time in there to get lost...you know me!  I planned to get good sleep Friday night, but I was visiting with a friend that I haven't spent much time with in years, so this didn't work out as planned.    I pop out of bed at 7:30 Saturday morning, change into my swimsuit and hit the road.  Luckily I left a with a little extra time, because I got lost (once again) in my friends neighborhood.  I love new cities.  I find it extremely exciting to explore and find out all there is to see and all the wonderful stores to shop.  My downfall is my horrible sense of direction.  You'd think with my car having a compass built in that I'd be fine...nope.  Anyway, back to my morning.  I finally find where I'm supposed to be swimming, and I'm right on time.  I had no idea there'd be so many women there.  I would estimate 200-300 women were there for the practice swim.  It could be more, as I tend to be an underestimator (not sure if that's an actual word).  I walk up, sign in, blah blah blah.  There was a time trial taking place just before my swim.  The swimmers were supposed to finish in less than 12 minutes...there's no way!  That's some pretty fast swimming (for me atleast).  When I first walked up, there were people holding three different signs to help and group us.  Basically they were going to send us in waves of 'experienced', 'intermediate', and 'what the heck am I thinking' groups.  I put myself in the intermediate group.  I wasn't terribly worried about my ability to swim, it was more the idea of swimming in the lake that had me scared.  While they separated us into our group, we received a few transition tips, but nothing I hadn't already heard or read, although it was nice (and free).  The 'experienced' swimmers were sent out first...there were only a handful of women willing to jump into this category.  Now it was time for me to strip down to my swimsuit and prepare for the water.  Here I am standing in the middle of hundreds of women all in their swimsuits, ready to jump in.  It was hard to be too scared because there were so many of us doing it.  There were buoys set up all in the water for us to take breaks holding onto.  We were told to swim to the first buoy, if we were tired take a break.  Then swim to the second, if you needed a break there, take it, but then swim back.  This would help you determine if you could complete the swim.  Okay, great, so now I have a way out.  It's finally my turn to step into the water.  The lake is springfed, so it was definitely chilly.  I let got in the water and let it come over my shoulders, within about 30 seconds, it was fine.  Here I go!  I swam to the first buoy and stopped for a second, mainly because I wasn't really sure how I felt.  I was somewhat tired, but not winded.  I rested for a second and started up again.  I passed the second one (it was pretty crowded), and rested again at the third.  This stop was similar to the first one, but I'm realizing by this time that I don't feel any different.  So, after the third buoy, I didn't stop again.  I think there were 6 or 8 total, I really don't remember for sure.  A few times during the swim, I quit concentrating on the swim and noticed how gross the water was, but mostly I only thought of my swim technique.  The swim was great!  I loved it!  Before the swim, I was talking with a girl in my wave and she compared an open water swim vs. the pool to running outside vs. the treadmill.  Afterward, I completely agree with this.  I am so excited now because I know I can do this part of the tri.  It's not nearly as intimidating now.    While I was waiting to swim I met another lady who invited me to tri course with a group early Sunday morning.  I decided this would much safer than attempting it myself.  After the swim, I decided to jog the trail around the lake so I could get a feel for my energy level.  I planned to run 1 or 2 miles, but ended up running 3, so that was nice.  It was still fairly early (maybe 10 o'clock), so it wasn't hot yet.    Saturday was a wonderful training day for me.  My energy and enthusiasm were both sky high.  After this, I took the rest of the day off of training, and decided to have a little fun in Austin.    Saturday night I was in bed by 10:45 (I probably shouldn't admit to that), this left me plenty of time to sleep before meeting at 8:30 to bike the course.  Things don't always work out as planned with me, lately sleep has become a huge factor for messing up my plans.  I woke up Sunday morning at about 10:45.  12 hours of sleep!!!!!  I couldn't tell you how long it has been since I've slept that much!  That would explain why I'm up typing after midnight, I'm nowhere near sleepy!  I decided I couldn't be completely lazy today, so I got my friend up and we decided to go for a neighborhood jog.  Today was much hotter and much more humid than yesterday.  I'm pretty sure the hills grew overnight too.  We took off in the neighborhood, neither of us knowing much about where we were (she just moved to Austin last week).  We decide to use the first hill (which begins at the driveway) as our warmup.  I think I was ready to call it quits by the time we finished the 'warm up'.  We start jogging and everything is good.  I'm sweating within moments, and I don't think I quit until about 2 hours later.  About 5 minutes into the run, I'm dying!  I'm such a wimp!  If I hadn't just run so great the morning before, this run would have deeply depressed me.  I'll go with my problem being a combo of too much sleep, heat, humidity, and hills.  None of which I'm used to!    Now I'm back in ugly, brown Abilene.  I think I love any city that's East of Abilene.  The drive back today almost depressed me because it began so beautiful, and it got less and less beautiful the closer I was to home.  Abilene actually isn't brown yet...give it a few weeks, it'll be there.  That's okay though, I'll be going home to East Texas this weekend.  I'm sure it'll be beautiful there too!         "}

The best part of this episode is where Homer shoots Flanders out of a canon and Flanders says as he's flying through the air, ' I can see my house!'. I don't know why but I laugh and laugh at that part. I remember being around the age of 8 or 9 and watching them at the cottage in South Hampton with my cousins and it was so much fun. I miss those days being a kid. I was talking with my cousin Natalie tonight and when we were younger we used to be so close and it's unfortuante that we've drifted apart. I know we're not alike anymore but her sister Angie I don't think are the same either but they get along great. It's a little weird how much Angie is like me when I was her age, but she's stuck with the lifestyle that I wanted and she suits it better then me.  So on friday I was ready to quit and have a nervous break down. I went with Russell in the morning cause he worked at 7 and I didn't start work till 12, so I had a nap in the truck for awhile and then went to see Boo, the grizzly at 10:30. He was playing in his pool and he was so darn cute splashing around. He picked up a stick and put it in his mouth and was throwing it around while he was in the pool, he is just so darn cute I would love to hug him but he'd probably rip my face off.   So it was a busy day and there was 3 of us on and Eric the retail guy was no where to be found. He was up at the Eagle Eye restaurant supposively doing work but Mike our shipper and receiver was sayin that he was chatting with everyone up there and not doing work. So when I had to go over to retail and someone had asked where this certain size was I didn't know and it looks bad when the person that works at the resort doesn't know whats going on or what to do. So I was freaking out and Mel was helping me too, but she was kinda freaking out too. So I went downstairs to where Eric keeps some of his sizes and I tore the place up. Fuck him for leaving us the store and theres no way that I'm going to put things back nicely after him leaving us alone! Right now he's probably loving this cause he's saving on labour cause he's so fucking lazy to hire someone! So later in the day Brenda left the cafeteria for us to look after and that was fine, but this huge group of English people wanted tea and ice cream so we were running around trying to help them and Justin the resort manager saw how we were panicking but he didn't do much to help out. And he still hasn't done anything to help out. He was the one who sent Eric up to the Eagle Eye and said that we would look after the retail store. He's such a fucking dick. At one point we had such a huge line of people and some of them were getting really pissed, but when they get up to the front of the line they start asking us really stupid questions and they don't stop asking questions. Like you just stood in line for a long time and I could see that you were getting really mad about how long you were standing in line for, but yet you want others to feel the same way and you don't want to help speed up the process. There were a few that did, but fuck some of the questions they ask. Like really were you born on another planet?  So that night I was there to look after guest services... like I should, and the cafeteria and the retail store! Just before 9 there was a storm that blew in and the gondola went on standby so then Eric couldn't come down to do his cash out and asked me to do it. I wasn't happy. So I did my cashout first and it was $500 over and I phoned Andrea up and she said to leave it for her to figure out the next day. Then I went over to retail and started his, but I couldn't find his cashout bag, float bag, any papers and so I phoned up to see if I could talk to him and he was eatting dinner and I said to the guy who answered the phone and said 'are you kidding me?' I thought he was doing work!?I was so mad at that point and phoned Andrea again and told what was going on and she said just put his stuff in a bag in the safe and she'd deal with it tommorrow. So I closed it up and went down to the safe. I opened the first door and thought that the combo looked funny like it had been locked and so I tried to open my combo and sure enough the other combo was locked so I phoned Andrea again and she said just hide the money and so I did. That was just the tip of the ice berg and I had had enough and so I finally go out of there by 10:30.  I went in on saturday to teach Patricia the combo for the safe and asked if Andrea had figured out my cashout and what had happend was that Mel had sold a jacket in retail but put the money on my till at guest services and she did some other stuff too on my till so it just messed me up so much but they were able to figure it out. Thank god. And then we talked about Eric and how he's not allowed to leave unless theres 3 of us and so that means that on friday, saturday and sunday between 12 and 4 he can leave but other then that he has to be at the store. Or else we'll close it and he'll lose out on sales. He talked to me for a bit and didn't even say sorry that he didn't get to make it down but all he said was that he really appreciated my help... ya right buddy fuck you! I really don't like him and I'm glad that I'm not working for him. Cause I'm sure I'd freak out cause when he talks he just keeps going and going and never shuts up!   Anywho... I was reading someones blog site tonight and it makes me a little jealous of someone. I don't really want to mention who but they have a new girlfriend now and well from what I've seen their not that attractive but they seem very intelligent. Compared to me, their IQ is probably double of what mine is but I know I'm prettier and far more adventurous. But I know if the person saw this he would probably beg to differ. But he and I have a past and like we've said to each other there will always be something between us that we can't explain, we will always like each other in that sort of way, and hell if we ever get divorced or never married then we'll be together. I know I have a great guy but knowing that another girl is with a guy that I know still likes me I just don't like that. I like it when everyone loves me and wants me and I'm sure every one loves that and I know you can't always have that, but I still like it.   Now it brings me to another point... Dreams about old boyfriends. Now lately I've been having dreams about my ex boyfriend Dan whom I haven't seen in like 3 years. In the dreams its like we're back together again and that same feeling is there. I know he's not the same person anymore but in my dreams he is. Its like we were never apart. I can still close my eyes and remember every thing. I used to look at him and well I guess I would say I would map out his face and I remember every dimple and I even remember how bad his eye brows were. I used to think we'd get married and we talked about it and now I'm glad we aren't together because I know he'd be an alcoholic like his father even though he didn't want to be like his dad at all, but the boy parties way too much. He can't go out and not have a beer. Russ can go out to the bar and not have a beer, he'll usually have a coke. Me I'll have one beer but I usually always have one drink, but I rarely drink. The last drink I had was probably a month ago. In ways Dan and I were so much alike and in other ways we were so different. I was a mother to him and at times he needed it and at times he hated it and I know he was embarrassed or mad but didn't want to say anything, but when he got drunk he got stupid. In ways I wish I could go back in time and relive my life cause I had so much fun and I loved the feelings that I felt with I was with Dan and even with Dave my old room mate whom I did date for a bit but I hurt him and then he ended up hurting me in the end. I'm afraid if I ever see Dave again the same feelings would come back because he is quite attractive. I know I could've married him... but would be happy? that's a hard one to answer. If I ever saw Dan now... well I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be attracted to him. He's very tall and lanky and he wasn' the most attractive guys but there was always something about him that I liked. Well its probably because our friends Jeff turned me down and our friend Brad wasn't making any moves so I figured Dan would be the best choice. Well he was for awhile.. well for college anyways. Lots of good memories and very few regrets. Anyways I'm going to bed. Hopefully this week isnt so crazy and hopefully Eric has hired someone.          "}

It\u2019s now widely recognized that transformation is a pre-requisite to their survival and growth. Business organizations in India especially public enterprises are experiencing winds of change. For the HR function, there could not be a more existing and challenging opportunity than managing the complexities of change and transformation. HR today is playing a lead role along with business functions in creating the necessary momentum and internal capabilities. This project seeks to capture the value of \u201cSynergizing HRD Interventions for Growth\u201d covering the ideas and experiences like Changing Business Scenario and HRD Challenges, Organizational Transformation  and Restructuring, Managing Performance and Productivity Enhancement, Managing Diversity, Developing Learning and Training Capabilities and Aligning HRD to Business.  HRD Interventions in Developing Global Competitiveness Today all are aware that it is the era of globalization and competitiveness. Right now the issue is not only of global competitiveness but local competitiveness. Till now, Indian industries have been so protected that it is not concerned about the emerging competition. These organizations today need to ask themselves where they are and where they need to go. Today\u2019s passwords should be competition for both survival and growth. To meet the new challenges, however, some of the organizations are planning well. As far as organizational planning is concerned Indian organizations are capable of planning well but regarding training and HRD interventions they are not performing too well and don\u2019t even give much importance to it. Normally everyone in the organization undergoes training. But to meet the emerging challenges and issues, organizations need to upgrade or modify their HRD interventions, or more specifically training interventions. NTPC is one of the few PSUs where attempts are being made to plan training interventions and a serious thought has been given it to make training a systematic method.  Benchmarking HRD Practices Benchmarking is a method of establishing goals based on industry\u2019s best practices. It\u2019s appositive and proactive process change practices and procedures in a structured fashion to achieve superior performance. Today when there is competition not only within India but the world over, and when one can get all information about product, processes and all management styles in minimum time, there is a need to have better or even international benchmarks. Benchmarking HRD practices may help organizations to develop action plans better manpower planning and developing human resources in amore effective manner to meet the challenges of the new millennium.  In order to make the kind of progress that is need to be competitive, HRD and quality professionals have to work in consonance with each other. It is one of the problems faced by many organizations. Why are things the way they are and what could be done to achieve a positive change? The 2 approaches to this problem have been followed since the early part of the century. One is the Human Resource approach, which promotes the ideas of freedom to act and freedom for creativity. The other is the Tailor\u2019s approach in terms of scientific management and in terms of standardization of method. In the early 20th century, mass manufacturing came into being. When a large number of people made the same kind of product of service, then a degree of standardization was necessary to obtain. A degree of consistency was needed to provide to the customers. This led to a situation where standardization became everything.  Human Resource approach talked about creativity. The conviction was that standardization kills creativity. If one prevents a person from thinking of a better way, and he is asked to do what he is supposed is inhuman. Unfortunately for several years these were considered to be mutually exclusively perspectives. Each one promoted and propagated their respective points of view and there were no meeting points. In the early 60s, the situation started changing. And in 1960-62, professor Ichikawa started the use of Quality Circles. What did he really do? He empowered the work force to develop the standards to develop themselves. Earlier the standards were often developed by industrial engineers sitting in the corporate office, and/or a handful of specialists in a company. But if the people who are in the job, whether they are at the operator/manager lever can be trained and empowered to develop their own standards. Ichikawa\u2019s QC is the collective creativity of a group of people doing diverse things who come together to develop their own methods working which is efficient. This is then standardized so that there is consistency till the end. He, thus, brought creativity and consistency through this approach.  It is important to train the manpower to use the data that\u2019s generated at the workplace. The basic steps in this exercise would be to understand the data, to use it analytically, and to find a better method. Automation in this perspective means that the worker or the manager should be able to stop his work process if it\u2019s proving to be inactive. A new standard may be created. If more than more 1 person is involved in this creative exercise, then the improvement may be of a higher magnitude than it would have been only one person developing it on his own. Each individual contributes and the group is able to bring their contributions together. For effective benchmarking of this kind, the 2 main factors are rich data and facts. Management looks at this data and decides the process as to how to do an analysis. The best known analytical tools are statistical tools. So statistical tools have to be used to involve people to create a better a method than the present one. Without creativity this form of benchmarking is not possible. Peter Drucker only recognized what the Japanese did. Basically it was the idea of Ichikawa who gave HRD this system of benchmarking.  Assessing and Evaluating the Impact of HRD interventions        A learning organization acquires knowledge, creates and transfers new knowledge and learns to perform better. Ultimately and organization has to perform and if the learning of the organization does not get transferred into performance then it is a waste. There are several roles of HRD, but the success of HRD can be judged by the performance of the organization. If it does not perform and if HRD personnel do not contribute to the organization in providing them the right environment and the right people, then the organization\u2019s HRD policy can be considered a failure.

We flew out of Des Moines at 5 on Friday,  and arrived in Seattle at about 11:00 their time which was 1am our time. Mary and I were really tired and the flight from Cincinatti to Seattle had been rough (we sat next to old people and old people + Turbulance = crying, screaming \u2026ie scary flight). Se we were tired and collecting our baggage, when my suitcase whizzed by me. Suddenly this guy comes up and grabs it for me. Then he comes over and asks if he can carry it for me too. We must\u2019ve had some strange looks on our faces because he chuckled and gathered me up in his arms in a bear hug and said, \u201cI\u2019m Joe, by the way, Libby\u2019s friend!\u201d Only then did Libby and her other friend Noel show up to validate his identity.              They were extremely hyper and excited to see us, which was good because Mary\u2019s luggage was lost. Had they not been so happy, I don\u2019t think Mary would have taken it as well as she did. The ride to Libby\u2019s Apartment was awesome. They were singing songs and telling jokes the whole time and Mary and I forgot how tired we were. We dropped Joe and Noel off at the base, but not before the guards searched the whole vehicle AND my luggage because there were civilians in the car. Ugh! Ah well, security I guess.   SATURDAY:             We met Andrew, Libby\u2019s roommate, bright and early in our pajamas. He works nights, so he was just getting home at 8:30 am. First off, he goes to the refrigerator and cracks open a Coors Light! I reacted from my gut \u201cUGH!\u201d before I could even check myself. I apologized because I didn\u2019t mean to be judgmental, but I had just woken up and a beer sounded like ass right then. So yeah, that\u2019s Andrew! The boy likes to talk\u2026more on him later.             We knew we needed to get Mary some clothes because the jeans and T-shirt she had with her were not going to cut it for a night out on the town in Seattle, so we picked up Noel and the base and met Libby\u2019s friend Georgia at the hotel in Seattle. He then headed to the waterfront for some lunch at a seafood restaurant where they just dump the food out on the table in front of you. Not a seafood eater, I had a burger but enjoyed watching Mary, Libby, and Noel scarf down two buckets full of fish and seafood. Then we hit the shopping district and spent way too much money, and got stuck in some sort of parade on our way back to the hotel to get ready for our night out.              We headed to Pioneer square to meet up with three guy friends from Libby\u2019s division: Mark, JD, and Asshole (can\u2019t remember his name\u2026but he was an asshole). We paid $12 to get into 12 clubs and had dinner at the bluesy bar called the New Orleans. We girls began the night with a shot (ugh\u2026can\u2019t believe I took one, I usually can\u2019t handle them bc I gag!), and the guys were pretty nice. We made our way to about 4 or five of the clubs, and got totally smashed.              The whole night I thought JD was kind of cute and asked Libby what she thought about the fact that I wanted to kiss him. She was okay with it. BUT then drama! Asshole kissed me first! Ugh\u2026didn\u2019t know what to do. So I kinda stayed away from Asshole for a while, but he kept trying to dance with me and hold my hand and I wanted to hang with JD! Finally, JD DID kiss me and it was great! And we danced and held hands from then until it was time to head back to the hotel.              Asshole was really being an asshole by then, so I grabbed his hand too and told him to calm down. So I\u2019m walking back to the hotel with JD on one side and Asshole on the other and then JD goes \u201cman would you let go of my girl?\u201d and Asshole goes \u201cYOUR girl, she was my girl first!\u201d As nice as it was to have two guys \u2018fighting\u2019 over me instead of the only one I really want not wanting me, I had to choose and I wanted JD so I chose him. Asshole ran off then to catch up with Georgia and Mary in the lead of our group for the rest of the ridiculous hike back to the hotel. He was pouting and being a jerk to Mary and Georgia the whole way. So, by way of punishment, Georgia made him (an the rest of us) walk an extra block! We got back to the hotel and I looked down at my feet to see that they were covered in blood! I had about six blisters from my new shoes, and some guy at the bar had stepped on my toe and broken half my big toenail off! OUCH! Luckily I was too drunk to really feel anything. ;)              So JD and I hooked up that night, to Asshole\u2019s great disappointment. The jerk even came up to me in the middle of the night and asked \u201cHey Leah, wanna fuck?\u201d Ick! NOT IN YOUR LIFETIME! But the whole thing was really awkward the next morning. So, I\u2019ve had my first one night stand and it was fun ;), but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be doing that again.  SUNDAY:             The guys left and I had to dish the details to all the girls. Turns out that this one-night stand would come up several embarrassing times throughout that vacation! More on that later.              We drove Georgia back to Everett, WA where her ship is docked and took the Kingston ferry, our first ferry trip for the vacation. Then we went to a BBQ with one of Libbys co-workers \u201ccountry\u201d a black guy who looks like a young Dave Chappelle. It was very awkward because 1. we didn\u2019t know anyone, and 2. we were the only three white girls there. The guys were all rappers and they tried to get me to sing since Libby told them I had a good voice. I was too shy to sing though, and I can\u2019t improvise very well. I do regret that I didn\u2019t try to sing something good for them though! Ah well. We left the bbq early and went back to Libby\u2019s apartment and just hung out until Libby had to go to bed (she had to work the next day).  MONDAY:             Libby had to work, so Mary and I slept in (on uncomfortable air mattresses in the living room\u2026with Andrew coming home and watching TV). Then we sat around and watched tv and talked with Andrew too long. By the time we were showered and dressed we only had an hour or so to kill until we had to pick Libby up at the base. So we checked out the mall in Silverdale (the town Libby actually lives in). Then we picked up Libby and got manicures and pedicures, went grocery shopping, cooked dinner, and watched a movie. Uneventful day. TUESDAY:             The gift that keeps on giving! We had washed our smoky bar clothes from the weekend and I guess I had the condom wrapper from my \u2018fling\u2019 in my back pocket because Andrew went to do some laundry Tuesday morning and found it in the drier.             \u201cWhat the hell? Who\u2019s shit is this, cuz I know it\u2019s not mine!\u201d he chuckles.             I grabbed it from him and tossed it in the trash\u2026wanting to be nonchalant. But not 10 minutes later he brought it up again, and I had to confess. He laughed and said \u201cat least someone in this house is getting some!\u201d But he didn\u2019t believe me that it was a one time thing and that I\u2019m not that kind of girl! L  grrr. I think maybe he was just teasing me.             So, Mary and I wasted the day in Bremerton. But by this time I had developed a lovely UTI and had to call home to get mom to finagle a prescription from our family doctor. She did and I got my medicine\u2026how inconvenient though! Ugh! We went to the \u201cboardwalk\u201d which is really just a concrete slab along the Puget Sound about two blocks long. It\u2019s brand new, so they don\u2019t have any shops there yet, but it has potential to be really neat.             Once Libby got off work, we met her at the base, and she and Joe took us on a tour of the USS Carl Vinson. It was friggin\u2019 Awesome! That thing is huge. I\u2019d get lost, in fact, Libby almost did showing us the ceremony room. All of a sudden she stopped on a ladder well, causing me to hit my head really hard on a pole! Ouch! Then, Joe showed us the flight deck and all the airplane equipment (the cables that they use to catch the planes, etc.) and I fell down two stairs and caught myself, pulling and/or stretching several muscles in my shoulder! We saw Libby\u2019s birthing and her rack which she has to climb like a monkey to get to. We then understood why she wanted to get an apartment. Living on that ship when you don\u2019t have to would suck! It was a neat experience going on an air craft carrier though, I only wish they would have allowed pictures.             Then, we went over to Sam Adams, a bar on base and had dinner with a bunch of sailors in Libby\u2019s division, all of whom had heard about my little fling! Guess how much fun that was! JD was supposed to come, but he stood us up, guess he was a little scared to face me. Ha!  WEDNESDAY:             Libby had duty Weds night, so she wouldn\u2019t be home, so Mary and I decided to spend the whole day in Seattle. We rode the 9am ferry from Bremerton to Seattle and slept the whole 50 mins. Then we took the trolley from the waterfront to the base of the space needle. We had a ton of fun up on the space needle. The tour guides up there are great! They have quite the sense of humor and they tell you a whole lot about the city. I felt like I learned a lot, and it helped us decide what to do with the rest of our day.             We then rode the ducks, which was hilarious! Our driver was Captain Obie Have! He played all kinds of music and told corny jokes that were funny because they were so corny, and he made fun of people on the street and on the duck. He was all excited because the Blue Angels were flying into Seattle for an airshow that weekend, and we actually saw them fly in on our tour!! It was great! We were bitter though because you don\u2019t get the quackers for free\u2026you have to pay $2! What a ripoff, they give \u2018em out for free in Branson, MO!!!             Then we rode the trolley back to the water front and ate at Red Robin\u2019s before heading to the aquarium, which was a huge disappointment. The tour guides at the space needle hyped it up, saying they had an octopus there (the largest octopi in the nation live in the Sound\u2026they can get up to 16ft!)..but it\u2019s just a puny one, and nothing else there is very impressive\u2026including the IMAX theatre which shows the eruption of Mt. St. Helens---BIG LET DOWN! By then It was getting late and we were tired, so we headed back to Bremerton. The shuttle ride home was cool though, we took some really neat pictures of the Seattle skyline.  THURSDAY:             We picked Libby up at 7am and headed to IHOP for a disappointing breakfast. Then we went back to the apartment to pack for a two day jaunt up to Vancouver, BC. That was a long drive, and we got a hotel and were headed downtown for the evening for dinner and sightseeing. That town smelled like vomit that whole night! Ick! It was pretty neat though. The lookout tower is a cheap imitation of the Space Needle though. Drama happened that night too\u2026my bank card didn\u2019t work. It caused a huge panic attack and I was so worried about money that night that I didn\u2019t have much fun. I guess it was just because I was in Canada that it didn\u2019t work\u2026but it was upsetting. The next day was much better.  FRIDAY:             It rained all day, so it didn\u2019t smell anymore, thank god! We headed back downtown to Gastown, a famous historic neighborhood in Vancouver. We looked around at a bunch of shops and went something called a \u201cStoryeum\u201d. It was a museum, but also a theatrical show. It told the history of BC through several different sets and actors all the way from glaciers to modern day. It was really interesting and I\u2019d never seen anything like it before. We had lunch at \u201cThe Old Spaghetti Factory\u201d in Gastown, which I guess is pretty famous, and good food too. Then we were headed over to Chinatown, but we passed some scary homeless people and a bad part of town and so we decided to head back to the hotel and get the car and head to the Capilano Suspension bridge and tree-top adventure.             That place was friggin\u2019 awesome! They had one big suspension bridge and then a bunch of wooded trails which lead to these tree houses. Then there are suspension bridges that hang 12ft high from cedar tree to cedar tree! We took a bunch of neat pictures, went across them twice and called home from one of the tree-houses! We got back late Friday night and headed to bed.  SATURDAY:             We packed for another 2 day jaunt to the Olympic National Forest and the coast. That was another long drive. We didn\u2019t get to the forest until 4pm, but that was alright. It was the Hoh Rainforest, one of the older forests in the park. The had three different trails and we took the short and the intermediate one and saw some cool trees and the rapids. We also saw a herd of Elk! We could hear them rustling the trees far off, and were looking through several trees to see them. Then, we came around a bend in the trail and there was one right in front of us! We could have touched it!! IT was humongous though so we didn\u2019t..lol. We just took lots of pictures. Then we got a little silly and pretended to be on \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d except everytime Libby said she was one of the female characters so she could get it on with one of the hotties, Mary would say she was said hottie and it ruined it! LoL. Then we headed back to our Hotel in Forks, WA and were all excited for a heated outdoor pool only to find that it was out of order! We hate you forking FORKS! So we went to  this pizzeria for dinner, but I didn\u2019t feel well, so it turned out I paid $6 for a single bite of pizza. Ugh. We made it an early night in Forks so we could head to the beach in the morning.  SUNDAY:             We were so excited for the beach. We shaved, got swimsuits on and blasted out the Beach Boys in the car on the way. BUT when we got there, the beach was no sunny, tanning, spend all day at the beach kind of beach. It was rocky and a little cold. The rocks were neat and there were lots of little rocky islands around, but it was a bit of a let down. So we spent a little bit of time there and decided to hit the road and stop at a few wineries on the way. FUN! Good wine, good friends, good times! We bought tons of wine between the three of us and got back to Bremerton about 7.             We got our bags organized so that we would be ready to leave for the airport the next morning and headed to a Mexican restaurant for dinner before going into Seattle to pick up Joe who had been visiting his girl over the weekend. BUT WHO was standing outside the restaurant? None other than JD. I think he saw us though, because he quickly got into the cab that was sitting at the curb and the cab didn\u2019t leave because they were waiting for JD\u2019s friend who must\u2019ve been in the bathroom. Scaredy Cat! Ha!             On the way to the airport to pick up Joe, the sun was setting, but through the trees I saw a huge snow capped mountain that could have been nothing but Mt. Rainier! All week long Libby had been saying that it had to be totally clear to see it, and that they only saw it a few days a year. But I kept asking about it, so they didn\u2019t believe me Sunday night when I said I saw it. We asked Joe when we picked him up and he went, \u201cYeah, that probably was Mt. Rainier!\u201d HA! I was right! We got back to the apartment LATE that night and had to get up at the butt crack of dawn to get Libby to work and us to the ferry station.  MONDAY:             Yeah, the night before was way short and we were TIRED that morning. Mt. Rainier was still there that morning, beautiful as ever! Libby got us to the ferry station, and I was sad to have to say such a quick good-bye because she had to get to work. I won\u2019t see her now until Christmas, or maybe even New Years.              Mary and I were there like 5 minutes before the 6:20am ferry was going to leave. We didn\u2019t HAVE to catch it, but we figured since we were there, we would. But that meant we had to practically run with our heavy bags. NOT A GOOD IDEA. My ankle decided to give out on me on the ramp to the ferry. OUCH! A nice man picked my bags up and helped me up and rolled them onto the ferry for me though. How friendly they were in Seattle! The ferry to the airport was great because Mt. Rainier was with us the whole way. It was even there when we were on the plane. What a way to bid us farewell Washington!  "}

Well her house was lovely but I couldn't settle down and I think mum had thought that I'd stay there with them for a week or so to get my head straight and to allow her some space but no sooner had I got there one day, I wanted to be away the next. Her Son Matthew made me nervous (a boy half my age) and I was even scared to interact with her daughter Charlotte who made me feel like a freak. I sat downstairs with Amanda and Mark (her husband) one evening, and we had a beer and watched football and had a curry and talked over things. I had a job to stop myself from crying and Amanda said that mum was just finding it difficult coping with me getting a boyfriend and that she was sure things would work out. She said she'd phone mum in the morning to say I was okay and to talk to her, and so very very late indeed we all went to bed and I lay awake most of the night. I didn't sleep.  There were things I could have done there. They had a kitten and the area was very pretty but I was just lonely and scared and I knew no-one. I was always twice as nervous as you Ben - even when I was double your age. You've got so much more going for you than I had. Everything's going well for you and I really cross my fingers you never get ill like I did. If you don't nothing can stop you.  I felt so nervous at Amandas that I couldn't stay so I told her I wanted to go home and she said okay she'd take me to the station. Saul sent a text saying why didn't I go in the morning and he'd meet me, we'd go for lunch or something and then I'd get the train home. So I met him and we went for something to eat and I came and saw his flat which was okay but was as all mens flats where they live alone are - it needed cleaning and redecorating. (least of my worries). We watched a bit of tv, I calmed down and then he took me to the station and I came home. I remember mum making an effort to make things better but I was so nervous. She cooked me my favourite meal which at the time was fried rice, and I didn't even eat it I felt so sick.  It ticked along for a fortnight and then came the time when I had to decide whether I ever wanted to see Saul again, or whether I should just say sorry I couldn't. And I've got no idea what would have happened if I'd have said sorry no I couldn't, but at the time I was so scared that I needed a friend so losing him seemed unbearable. When mum and me had argued I used to run over to the field and sit under the tree on the hill on the phone to him crying and I had no idea what to do but I wanted to talk to someone. The more mum shouted at me trying to get me to stop seeing Saul, the more nervous and scared of what was happening I got. And so what mum did was push us closer together and not actually what she intended which was to pull us apart.  Looking back on it, theres no way of knowing whether if she hadn't been so angry and reacted the way she did, we'd have ever got as close so quickly. I actually doubt it. Because what ended up happening was that mum and dad said one day 'What do you want to do then? You want to go and stay with him for a few months to get your head straight?!' and I think they were joking but after one of our arguements thats what I did. I took my money out and got the train to Paddington and sent him a text saying 'please can I come and stay with you for a bit' and he wasn't sure at the time. But he said yes.  You see we hadn't known each other all that long really. And even though we were good friends, its one thing being friends and its another staying under the same roof as someone for a fortnight or more. Things didn't get any better for me. I don't know what it was like at home then but dad sent me text messages daily to find out whether I was okay. I thought he cared then and even though we'd all argued I felt safe enough. Saul looked after me and although I spent most days crying he seemed to understand why. He liked mummy and daddy you see. His mum and dad were always horrible to him and when he came down the first two times, he said to me he wished he had parents like ours. In fact he said that he wished he could be part of the family because he felt so safe there with us. I dont remember much of the good stuff from that first visit really. I remember him playing on the playstation with you and you beating him, and him farting lots but other than that most of it is a blank.  Anyway about 2 months later I came home. I'd lost a lot of weight. That was about the first time in my life I've fitted into a size twelve! I think mum was glad to have me home. But things didn't get any better. Things just yoyoed getting worse and then slightly better and then much worse. Things wouldn't happen much when you were home which I'm glad of. I wouldn't have liked you to see it all. We'd take you to school and I'd get home and it would be just me and mum and we'd argue and I'd cry and she'd follow me around the house shouting trying to get me to do what she wanted or to get through to me what she thought was wrong. I know you'll find it hard to understand - I hope you never find out what thats like but I felt nervous when it was just me and mum at home. I tried not to mention Saul, and even though I went to see him for the day here and there I thought the best way to deal with things was to pretend it wasn't there. Which was probably stupid.  Then one day we were in town and shopping in Somerfields and Judy (do you remember big fat scary Judy?) came in and shouted something stupid like 'How's the Saulrus?' and I hadn't prompted her to say it. There was nothing I dreaded her saying more really, but I couldn't shut her up. She just grinned and kept asking about it. Mummy got upset and threw the basket at me and shouted and called me names right in front of everyone and that was when it got really bad. I know mum didn't mean half of the things she said. But they hurt so much. I am a coward. I can't cope with things the way I used to.  I never cried until I got ill and then I seemed to cry all of the time. I left for another stay with Saul hoping things would calm down. Which they didn't. It just happened like that for ages and ages, with me coming home, things getting bad, and then me leaving again. And it nearly killed me and probably did the same to mum and dad too. I don't think it was anything any of us wanted. One day mum said that we needed help and I thought 'thank god - she wants us to all go and see someone to get help to cope with this' but she didn't mean that. She thought I was mad and needed help - and that she was perfectly fine. And that was when things hit rock bottom.  I left and I was gone for about 6 months. Dad kept texting me threatening to sell the car and I'd be sat here in the flat, dreading that bleep from the phone because although it meant that he remembered who I was, it also meant he was going to say more things that would hurt me and I'd sit there and cry and cry and Saul would come home from work and find me sat staring at the wall. In fact he himself thought I needed help at one point. I think I did too - I thought I was losing it. We went on holiday to Scotland. Saul thought it would be a good idea to get away and to calm down a bit and I desperately wanted to get out of London because it takes a lot of getting used to.  I remember one day feeling low. Really low. I was thinking about Granny and how she had various mental problems and I was thinking maybe I was like her, and that maybe I was a nut afterall. I was angry that I wasn't able to see you anymore and I was blaming myself. I sat there and watched some family on this cruise boat we went on around the islands and this girl was bouncing her brother on her knee and I swear I was so upset I felt I had no choice but to leave the same room as them. Because if I hadn't I think I'd have either pushed the whole family over the side of the boat in sheer frustration (and then got arrested) or cried in front of everyone. I did enjoy the holiday and I think some of my first good memories of being with Saul come from there.  I showed you pictures didn't I. Those are things I hold onto in my head.  When we got back though it was the same as before. Dad was phoning all of the time saying I should go back because I was enrolled on the full time course at Lackham and I needed to have an interview. I phoned and rearranged the interview so I could make it when we got back from the holiday and then about 2 days before the interview they phoned and said the course had been cancelled. That left a void because that was what was making Dad want me back home and if you took that away it meant that the only thing that could get me home was mum somehow changing her mood. And she didn't.  I was so upset Ben. I know you think I probably was out having fun and I was coping and that you and mum and dad were the only ones upset but if truth be told most of the times I expect you were sat there thinking about me, I was sat in a room with the lights off crying my eyes out wondering what on earth I could do to get you back.  And nothing has changed. Right now I'm sat here writing this hoping that one day you'll read this and the daily diary entries I make and understand me and not hate me. I really honestly thought things were getting better when I started the part time college course. I had it planned out in my head and I thought if I could only get through that course everything could fall back into place but it never did.  It started off okay. We were talking about me getting a part time job to help pay for the course etc but then mum and dad started finding jobs for me that meant that I would need to move back home and if I did that I would have lost Saul. You'll understand one day what I mean when I say that I just couldn't lose him. He felt like my security mattress against the world - and my best friend all rolled into one. If anything happened I knew that I could always fall apart and he'd help me pick up the pieces.  College was great. I could see my work coming on in leaps and bounds. I planned that Saul would finish his nursing course around the time I had finished my first year of study, and that I could maybe persuade him to move down to Bath or somewhere close and then things would be much easier. I could see everyone without being torn in all directions. And once I'd qualified I was going to work as a freelance designer and he could do his nursing and I'd do my garden design, and we'd live somewhere close to you so that you could come around whenever you wanted etc. I imagined mum helping me sort out curtains and bringing around old duvets etc. Because I think if things had been okay she'd have done all that. Because we were best friends too. When Saul was working nights I imagined you all coming over, and me cooking and things being normal.  That vision felt so good. Then at Christmas mum got upset again about Saul not sharing out some sweets and things got bad again. In front of you I tried not to cry or to show that things were happening but they were and in the most unlikely places. For instance we went out for a walk and no sooner had we got around the corner of the road mum started shouting at me again. So I came home in tears and the next day was gone again.  And I stupidly thought that in January after the stuff that happened at Christmas, mum would have calmed down and I'd still be able to go to college and come down and stay with you and we could do fun stuff and then I'd go back to live with saul for the rest of the week. But when I came down In January mum refused to speak to me, and dad told me he thought Saul was gay and by the time I got home from the station I was crying and mum wouldn't come in the same room as me. I'd promised you that I'd take you swimming and I was looking forward to it and then the morning you went to school, mum and dad came in and sat down and started on me.  It was the same conversations as before only more extreme. Mum said that I had to make up my mind where I wanted to live because they wouldn't let me visit anymore. I had to either go back to live with you and see Saul once a month or something, or leave and if that was the case she said I could never come back. I was really upset and I ran upstairs and mum followed me up. It went very bizarrely in moods. One moment she'd see me in tears and wonder what on earth had happened between us to get it that bad, and she'd come and hug me. And the next she'd be slapping me and shouting again. I remember this like it was yesterday. Dad was on the landing doing the new bannisters, and mum came into my room where I was stood crying looking out of the window. She said 'If you leave this house you'll never see Ben again because I won't let you. It's not fair on him. He's got so much going for him and I won't have you messing his life up as well as your own'.  Dad said 'don't say things like that' but mum kept on saying that they had to think of you and that I was doing you no good. And I suddenly felt so hated. The next day mum went out all day and wouldn't stay in the house with me, and so I got dad to give me a lift and I left. I honestly felt hated. How else could mum say something like that? How else could she think that I'd ever do anything to harm you or lead you astray? I worshiped the ground you walked on and I loved you more than life itself.  And now you're just as huge a part in my life as ever only now I have to sit here staring at a picture instead of seeing your grinning face staring back at me over the dinner table. Busy pushing the chicken around the plate because you don't like it and eating nothing but the mashed potato. And now I'm sat here crying again. You see my life will never be complete without you. You are my brother and I love you sooo much. I just wish you could understand how I feel, and see that things aren't as you think they are.  This sort of brings me to the end of this entry but I want to write more because its all flowing out and I'm in tears and Saul is out so its best I get it all out of my system and into this BLOG while I have the chance and it doesn't mean Saul seeing me in such a state. The next entry will be about things which are happening now.            "}
