Thats way early, For the record, my vacation has been filled with days where Im getting up really early, which after a night of shooting/partying, is really fun, I must say. So we get over to AUC to meet with the students. We jump in three separate cars and head over to the outskirts of Heliopolis. The plan is really simple: we head to a meeting point where we will meet with Norhans dad, who will then lead the way over to the construction site. If only simple things could remain simple in Egypt. So we get to our meeting point to wait for Norhans dad. He gets there, and we begin to follow him. Four cars. Norhans dad is leading the way. Well, our driver (an AUC provided driver) decides to pass Norhans dad. Why? I have no idea. Another AUC driver does the same. Now, John and I are riding in the back seat, talking with Jan, who is riding up front. Were not really paying attention to whats going on  were assuming that our driver can do is prescribed job of following the car in front of him. So about 25 minutes later, the other AUC driver zips up next to us and flags us down, letting us know that weve passed the exit. (Mighty considerate of him, to do so  otherwise we might end up all the way in Sharm.) So we need to make a U-turn, which is not as simple as it seems because the highways in Egypt arent designed like they are back in the states. The next exit/U-turn is like 10 miles down the road. So we make the U-turn and come back to another exit about another 5 miles beyond the exit that we missed so we can make another U-turn. We do so, get off on the exit, and then stop. We dont see anybody. So we ask the other driver if he saw where everyone went. He didnt. He just saw the exit that he knew we were supposed to get off on, so he flagged us down. This led to about an hours worth of confusion. We call Norhan, who is with her dad, to see if she can give us directions. She cant, because she has no idea where we are. (Oh yeah, did I mention that streets in certain parts of Egypt dont have names? That makes it way easy to figure out where you are.) So we jumped back on the highway, looking for another exit. We literally drove back and forth (in 10 and 5 mile increments) making u-turn after u-turn, trying to get off on the right exit. So it turns out that after we passed everybody, they passed us again and kept going. So we never passed an exit where they had gotten off. We finally made it to the construction site about and hour later (after one of the girls jumped back on the highway, found us and led us back to the site.)

So we make the U-turn and come back to another exit about another 5 miles beyond the exit that we missed so we can make another U-turn. We do so, get off on the exit, and then stop. We dont see anybody. So we ask the other driver if he saw where everyone went. He didnt. He just saw the exit that he knew we were supposed to get off on, so he flagged us down. This led to about an hours worth of confusion. We call Norhan, who is with her dad, to see if she can give us directions. She cant, because she has no idea where we are. (Oh yeah, did I mention that streets in certain parts of Egypt dont have names? That makes it way easy to figure out where you are.) So we jumped back on the highway, looking for another exit. We literally drove back and forth (in 10 and 5 mile increments) making u-turn after u-turn, trying to get off on the right exit. So it turns out that after we passed everybody, they passed us again and kept going. So we never passed an exit where they had gotten off. We finally made it to the construction site about and hour later (after one of the girls jumped back on the highway, found us and led us back to the site.) Needless to say, Jan was less than pleased with this whole incident, but John and I (partially because of sleep deprivation) thought it was hysterical. Filming on the construction site was fun. Lets just say that construction standards in Egypt are just a little different than in the US. The girls had a fun time climbing up an inclined plank (not attached to anything) that led from the ground level to the second floor, where the workers were building part of the second floor foundation. Fortunately, a nice breeze kept us relatively cool  it was probably only 100 degrees, but the wind made it feel a little cooler. The lack of humidity helps.

The best part of this episode is where Homer shoots Flanders out of a canon and Flanders says as hes flying through the air,  I can see my house!. I dont know why but I laugh and laugh at that part. I remember being around the age of 8 or 9 and watching them at the cottage in South Hampton with my cousins and it was so much fun. I miss those days being a kid. I was talking with my cousin Natalie tonight and when we were younger we used to be so close and its unfortuante that weve drifted apart. I know were not alike anymore but her sister Angie I dont think are the same either but they get along great. Its a little weird how much Angie is like me when I was her age, but shes stuck with the lifestyle that I wanted and she suits it better then me. So on friday I was ready to quit and have a nervous break down. I went with Russell in the morning cause he worked at 7 and I didnt start work till 12, so I had a nap in the truck for awhile and then went to see Boo, the grizzly at 10:30. He was playing in his pool and he was so darn cute splashing around. He picked up a stick and put it in his mouth and was throwing it around while he was in the pool, he is just so darn cute I would love to hug him but hed probably rip my face off. So it was a busy day and there was 3 of us on and Eric the retail guy was no where to be found. He was up at the Eagle Eye restaurant supposively doing work but Mike our shipper and receiver was sayin that he was chatting with everyone up there and not doing work. So when I had to go over to retail and someone had asked where this certain size was I didnt know and it looks bad when the person that works at the resort doesnt know whats going on or what to do. So I was freaking out and Mel was helping me too, but she was kinda freaking out too. So I went downstairs to where Eric keeps some of his sizes and I tore the place up. Fuck him for leaving us the store and theres no way that Im going to put things back nicely after him leaving us alone!

Just before 9 there was a storm that blew in and the gondola went on standby so then Eric couldnt come down to do his cash out and asked me to do it. I wasnt happy. So I did my cashout first and it was $500 over and I phoned Andrea up and she said to leave it for her to figure out the next day. Then I went over to retail and started his, but I couldnt find his cashout bag, float bag, any papers and so I phoned up to see if I could talk to him and he was eatting dinner and I said to the guy who answered the phone and said are you kidding me? I thought he was doing work!?I was so mad at that point and phoned Andrea again and told what was going on and she said just put his stuff in a bag in the safe and shed deal with it tommorrow. So I closed it up and went down to the safe. I opened the first door and thought that the combo looked funny like it had been locked and so I tried to open my combo and sure enough the other combo was locked so I phoned Andrea again and she said just hide the money and so I did. That was just the tip of the ice berg and I had had enough and so I finally go out of there by 10:30. I went in on saturday to teach Patricia the combo for the safe and asked if Andrea had figured out my cashout and what had happend was that Mel had sold a jacket in retail but put the money on my till at guest services and she did some other stuff too on my till so it just messed me up so much but they were able to figure it out. Thank god. And then we talked about Eric and how hes not allowed to leave unless theres 3 of us and so that means that on friday, saturday and sunday between 12 and 4 he can leave but other then that he has to be at the store."}

I had no idea thered be so many women there. I would estimate 200-300 women were there for the practice swim. It could be more, as I tend to be an underestimator (not sure if thats an actual word). I walk up, sign in, blah blah blah. There was a time trial taking place just before my swim. The swimmers were supposed to finish in less than 12 minutes...theres no way! Thats some pretty fast swimming (for me atleast). When I first walked up, there were people holding three different signs to help and group us. Basically they were going to send us in waves of experienced, intermediate, and what the heck am I thinking groups. I put myself in the intermediate group. I wasnt terribly worried about my ability to swim, it was more the idea of swimming in the lake that had me scared. While they separated us into our group, we received a few transition tips, but nothing I hadnt already heard or read, although it was nice (and free). The experienced swimmers were sent out first...there were only a handful of women willing to jump into this category. Now it was time for me to strip down to my swimsuit and prepare for the water. Here I am standing in the middle of hundreds of women all in their swimsuits, ready to jump in. It was hard to be too scared because there were so many of us doing it. There were buoys set up all in the water for us to take breaks holding onto. We were told to swim to the first buoy, if we were tired take a break. Then swim to the second, if you needed a break there, take it, but then swim back. This would help you determine if you could complete the swim. Okay, great, so now I have a way out. Its finally my turn to step into the water. The lake is springfed, so it was definitely chilly. I let got in the water and let it come over my shoulders, within about 30 seconds, it was fine. Here I go!"}

It was still fairly early (maybe 10 oclock), so it wasnt hot yet. Saturday was a wonderful training day for me. My energy and enthusiasm were both sky high. After this, I took the rest of the day off of training, and decided to have a little fun in Austin. Saturday night I was in bed by 10:45 (I probably shouldnt admit to that), this left me plenty of time to sleep before meeting at 8:30 to bike the course. Things dont always work out as planned with me, lately sleep has become a huge factor for messing up my plans. I woke up Sunday morning at about 10:45. 12 hours of sleep!!!!! I couldnt tell you how long it has been since Ive slept that much! That would explain why Im up typing after midnight, Im nowhere near sleepy! I decided I couldnt be completely lazy today, so I got my friend up and we decided to go for a neighborhood jog. Today was much hotter and much more humid than yesterday. Im pretty sure the hills grew overnight too. We took off in the neighborhood, neither of us knowing much about where we were (she just moved to Austin last week). We decide to use the first hill (which begins at the driveway) as our warmup. I think I was ready to call it quits by the time we finished the warm up. We start jogging and everything is good. Im sweating within moments, and I dont think I quit until about 2 hours later. About 5 minutes into the run, Im dying! Im such a wimp! If I hadnt just run so great the morning before, this run would have deeply depressed me. Ill go with my problem being a combo of too much sleep, heat, humidity, and hills. None of which Im used to! Now Im back in ugly, brown Abilene. I think I love any city thats East of Abilene."}

This is the story of tom dowd. I think he is wrong so I say tomdowdiswrong and he thinks he is right so he says tomdowisright but I say tomdowdiswrong and that\u2019s what they say. And after that I say chris is a fraud and everyone says chris is a fraud because his name is fraud. And then he kills it and the fraud dies and he is chris the un fraud. And then he kills it again and then they say he is and he says he isn\u2019t and we get the erra. And then the evil one is evil and he is a fraud again but they do not say fraud and I do not say fraud but he is one. Then he is not fraud until he kills it again and again he is a fraud. When he kills it he does back and he is a not fraud. Now he is a fraud but no one says it. The evil one is still evil but the fraud does nothing again."}

We got back to the hotel and I looked down at my feet to see that they were covered in blood! I had about six blisters from my new shoes, and some guy at the bar had stepped on my toe and broken half my big toenail off! OUCH! Luckily I was too drunk to really feel anything. ;)              So JD and I hooked up that night, to Asshole\u2019s great disappointment.

So, I\u2019ve had my first one night stand and it was fun ;), but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be doing that again. SUNDAY:             The guys left and I had to dish the details to all the girls. Turns out that this one-night stand would come up several embarrassing times throughout that vacation! More on that later. We drove Georgia back to Everett, WA where her ship is docked and took the Kingston ferry, our first ferry trip for the vacation. Then we went to a BBQ with one of Libbys co-workers \u201ccountry\u201d a black guy who looks like a young Dave Chappelle. It was very awkward because 1. we didn\u2019t know anyone, and 2. we were the only three white girls there. The guys were all rappers and they tried to get me to sing since Libby told them I had a good voice. I was too shy to sing though, and I can\u2019t improvise very well. I do regret that I didn\u2019t try to sing something good for them though! Ah well. We left the bbq early and went back to Libby\u2019s apartment and just hung out until Libby had to go to bed (she had to work the next day)."}

We had washed our smoky bar clothes from the weekend and I guess I had the condom wrapper from my \u2018fling\u2019 in my back pocket because Andrew went to do some laundry Tuesday morning and found it in the drier. \u201cWhat the hell? Who\u2019s shit is this, cuz I know it\u2019s not mine!\u201d he chuckles. I grabbed it from him and tossed it in the trash\u2026wanting to be nonchalant. But not 10 minutes later he brought it up again, and I had to confess. He laughed and said \u201cat least someone in this house is getting some!\u201d But he didn\u2019t believe me that it was a one time thing and that I\u2019m not that kind of girl! L  grrr. I think maybe he was just teasing me. So, Mary and I wasted the day in Bremerton. But by this time I had developed a lovely UTI and had to call home to get mom to finagle a prescription from our family doctor. She did and I got my medicine\u2026how inconvenient though! Ugh! We went to the \u201cboardwalk\u201d which is really just a concrete slab along the Puget Sound about two blocks long. It\u2019s brand new, so they don\u2019t have any shops there yet, but it has potential to be really neat. Once Libby got off work, we met her at the base, and she and Joe took us on a tour of the USS Carl Vinson. It was friggin\u2019 Awesome! That thing is huge. I\u2019d get lost, in fact, Libby almost did showing us the ceremony room. All of a sudden she stopped on a ladder well, causing me to hit my head really hard on a pole! Ouch! Then, Joe showed us the flight deck and all the airplane equipment (the cables that they use to catch the planes, etc.) and I fell down two stairs and caught myself, pulling and/or stretching several muscles in my shoulder!"}

WEDNESDAY:             Libby had duty Weds night, so she wouldn\u2019t be home, so Mary and I decided to spend the whole day in Seattle. We rode the 9am ferry from Bremerton to Seattle and slept the whole 50 mins. Then we took the trolley from the waterfront to the base of the space needle. We had a ton of fun up on the space needle. The tour guides up there are great! They have quite the sense of humor and they tell you a whole lot about the city. I felt like I learned a lot, and it helped us decide what to do with the rest of our day. We then rode the ducks, which was hilarious! Our driver was Captain Obie Have! He played all kinds of music and told corny jokes that were funny because they were so corny, and he made fun of people on the street and on the duck."}

Then, we went over to Sam Adams, a bar on base and had dinner with a bunch of sailors in Libby\u2019s division, all of whom had heard about my little fling! Guess how much fun that was! JD was supposed to come, but he stood us up, guess he was a little scared to face me. Ha! WEDNESDAY:             Libby had duty Weds night, so she wouldn\u2019t be home, so Mary and I decided to spend the whole day in Seattle. We rode the 9am ferry from Bremerton to Seattle and slept the whole 50 mins. Then we took the trolley from the waterfront to the base of the space needle. We had a ton of fun up on the space needle. The tour guides up there are great! They have quite the sense of humor and they tell you a whole lot about the city. I felt like I learned a lot, and it helped us decide what to do with the rest of our day. We then rode the ducks, which was hilarious! Our driver was Captain Obie Have! He played all kinds of music and told corny jokes that were funny because they were so corny, and he made fun of people on the street and on the duck. He was all excited because the Blue Angels were flying into Seattle for an airshow that weekend, and we actually saw them fly in on our tour!! It was great! We were bitter though because you don\u2019t get the quackers for free\u2026you have to pay $2! What a ripoff, they give \u2018em out for free in Branson, MO!!! Then we rode the trolley back to the water front and ate at Red Robin\u2019s before heading to the aquarium, which was a huge disappointment.

The shuttle ride home was cool though, we took some really neat pictures of the Seattle skyline. THURSDAY:             We picked Libby up at 7am and headed to IHOP for a disappointing breakfast.

Then we went back to the apartment to pack for a two day jaunt up to Vancouver, BC. That was a long drive, and we got a hotel and were headed downtown for the evening for dinner and sightseeing. That town smelled like vomit that whole night! Ick! It was pretty neat though. The lookout tower is a cheap imitation of the Space Needle though. Drama happened that night too\u2026my bank card didn\u2019t work. It caused a huge panic attack and I was so worried about money that night that I didn\u2019t have much fun. I guess it was just because I was in Canada that it didn\u2019t work\u2026but it was upsetting. The next day was much better. FRIDAY:             It rained all day, so it didn\u2019t smell anymore, thank god! We headed back downtown to Gastown, a famous historic neighborhood in Vancouver. We looked around at a bunch of shops and went something called a \u201cStoryeum\u201d. It was a museum, but also a theatrical show. It told the history of BC through several different sets and actors all the way from glaciers to modern day. It was really interesting and I\u2019d never seen anything like it before. We had lunch at \u201cThe Old Spaghetti Factory\u201d in Gastown, which I guess is pretty famous, and good food too. Then we were headed over to Chinatown, but we passed some scary homeless people and a bad part of town and so we decided to head back to the hotel and get the car and head to the Capilano Suspension bridge and tree-top adventure. That place was friggin\u2019 awesome! They had one big suspension bridge and then a bunch of wooded trails which lead to these tree houses. Then there are suspension bridges that hang 12ft high from cedar tree to cedar tree! We took a bunch of neat pictures, went across them twice and called home from one of the tree-houses! We got back late Friday night and headed to bed. SATURDAY:             We packed for another 2 day jaunt to the Olympic National Forest and the coast."}

So we spent a little bit of time there and decided to hit the road and stop at a few wineries on the way. FUN! Good wine, good friends, good times! We bought tons of wine between the three of us and got back to Bremerton about 7. We got our bags organized so that we would be ready to leave for the airport the next morning and headed to a Mexican restaurant for dinner before going into Seattle to pick up Joe who had been visiting his girl over the weekend. BUT WHO was standing outside the restaurant? None other than JD. I think he saw us though, because he quickly got into the cab that was sitting at the curb and the cab didn\u2019t leave because they were waiting for JD\u2019s friend who must\u2019ve been in the bathroom. Scaredy Cat! Ha! On the way to the airport to pick up Joe, the sun was setting, but through the trees I saw a huge snow capped mountain that could have been nothing but Mt. Rainier! All week long Libby had been saying that it had to be totally clear to see it, and that they only saw it a few days a year. But I kept asking about it, so they didn\u2019t believe me Sunday night when I said I saw it."}

Then one day we were in town and shopping in Somerfields and Judy (do you remember big fat scary Judy?) came in and shouted something stupid like Hows the Saulrus? and I hadnt prompted her to say it. There was nothing I dreaded her saying more really, but I couldnt shut her up. She just grinned and kept asking about it. Mummy got upset and threw the basket at me and shouted and called me names right in front of everyone and that was when it got really bad. I know mum didnt mean half of the things she said. But they hurt so much. I am a coward. I cant cope with things the way I used to. I never cried until I got ill and then I seemed to cry all of the time. I left for another stay with Saul hoping things would calm down. Which they didnt. It just happened like that for ages and ages, with me coming home, things getting bad, and then me leaving again. And it nearly killed me and probably did the same to mum and dad too. I dont think it was anything any of us wanted. One day mum said that we needed help and I thought thank god - she wants us to all go and see someone to get help to cope with this but she didnt mean that. She thought I was mad and needed help - and that she was perfectly fine. And that was when things hit rock bottom. I left and I was gone for about 6 months. Dad kept texting me threatening to sell the car and Id be sat here in the flat, dreading that bleep from the phone because although it meant that he remembered who I was, it also meant he was going to say more things that would hurt me and Id sit there and cry and cry and Saul would come home from work and find me sat staring at the wall."}

In fact he himself thought I needed help at one point. I think I did too - I thought I was losing it. We went on holiday to Scotland. Saul thought it would be a good idea to get away and to calm down a bit and I desperately wanted to get out of London because it takes a lot of getting used to. I remember one day feeling low. Really low. I was thinking about Granny and how she had various mental problems and I was thinking maybe I was like her, and that maybe I was a nut afterall. I was angry that I wasnt able to see you anymore and I was blaming myself. I sat there and watched some family on this cruise boat we went on around the islands and this girl was bouncing her brother on her knee and I swear I was so upset I felt I had no choice but to leave the same room as them. Because if I hadnt I think Id have either pushed the whole family over the side of the boat in sheer frustration (and then got arrested) or cried in front of everyone. I did enjoy the holiday and I think some of my first good memories of being with Saul come from there."}

Dad kept texting me threatening to sell the car and Id be sat here in the flat, dreading that bleep from the phone because although it meant that he remembered who I was, it also meant he was going to say more things that would hurt me and Id sit there and cry and cry and Saul would come home from work and find me sat staring at the wall. In fact he himself thought I needed help at one point. I think I did too - I thought I was losing it. We went on holiday to Scotland. Saul thought it would be a good idea to get away and to calm down a bit and I desperately wanted to get out of London because it takes a lot of getting used to. I remember one day feeling low. Really low. I was thinking about Granny and how she had various mental problems and I was thinking maybe I was like her, and that maybe I was a nut afterall. I was angry that I wasnt able to see you anymore and I was blaming myself. I sat there and watched some family on this cruise boat we went on around the islands and this girl was bouncing her brother on her knee and I swear I was so upset I felt I had no choice but to leave the same room as them. Because if I hadnt I think Id have either pushed the whole family over the side of the boat in sheer frustration (and then got arrested) or cried in front of everyone. I did enjoy the holiday and I think some of my first good memories of being with Saul come from there. I showed you pictures didnt I. Those are things I hold onto in my head. When we got back though it was the same as before. Dad was phoning all of the time saying I should go back because I was enrolled on the full time course at Lackham and I needed to have an interview. I phoned and rearranged the interview so I could make it when we got back from the holiday and then about 2 days before the interview they phoned and said the course had been cancelled. That left a void because that was what was making Dad want me back home and if you took that away it meant that the only thing that could get me home was mum somehow changing her mood."}

I sat there and watched some family on this cruise boat we went on around the islands and this girl was bouncing her brother on her knee and I swear I was so upset I felt I had no choice but to leave the same room as them. Because if I hadnt I think Id have either pushed the whole family over the side of the boat in sheer frustration (and then got arrested) or cried in front of everyone. I did enjoy the holiday and I think some of my first good memories of being with Saul come from there. I showed you pictures didnt I. Those are things I hold onto in my head. When we got back though it was the same as before. Dad was phoning all of the time saying I should go back because I was enrolled on the full time course at Lackham and I needed to have an interview. I phoned and rearranged the interview so I could make it when we got back from the holiday and then about 2 days before the interview they phoned and said the course had been cancelled. That left a void because that was what was making Dad want me back home and if you took that away it meant that the only thing that could get me home was mum somehow changing her mood. And she didnt. I was so upset Ben. I know you think I probably was out having fun and I was coping and that you and mum and dad were the only ones upset but if truth be told most of the times I expect you were sat there thinking about me, I was sat in a room with the lights off crying my eyes out wondering what on earth I could do to get you back. And nothing has changed. Right now Im sat here writing this hoping that one day youll read this and the daily diary entries I make and understand me and not hate me. I really honestly thought things were getting better when I started the part time college course. I had it planned out in my head and I thought if I could only get through that course everything could fall back into place but it never did. It started off okay. We were talking about me getting a part time job to help pay for the course etc but then mum and dad started finding jobs for me that meant that I would need to move back home and if I did that I would have lost Saul. Youll understand one day what I mean when I say that I just couldnt lose him."}

Let me start by saying that at the front desk of the YMCA, the people who work there are pretty much the communication center of the building, but they are not the ones who make the decisions in regards to how the building and programs are run.

Thats when I asked for above items and received them. 53. I never liked any of my Mothers boyfriends when growing up 54. I never quite fitted into a clique. I was the playground nomad but still managed to make life long friends 55. I love uni for the knowledge I have gained. I have never been into the social side of things 56. I volunteer every Saturday morning teaching kids computer stuff 57. I love dancing 58. I am always looking for a diet to start on Monday - I never do 59. The most weight Ive lost is with Weight Watchers 60. The Boy and I travelled to Thailand for 4 weeks in 2002 61. Sometimes I am hesitant about going overseas without The Boy 62. I have to start on my uni work, but I am more focused on finishing this list. See point 1. 63. Books are my way of escaping my reality & then placing myself in my own reality. They are beautiful and writers are angels 64. I cry at a drop of a hat 65. I love Singapore 66. I love Michael Jackson (The earlier years) 67. On The Boy and Is first date all I could hum afterwards was The Way You Make Me Feel by MJ 68. I would like to get married one day. Even though I tell everyone I dont want to 69. When I get my own place, I want a chocolate brown chaise &amp; 2 wooden trunks 70. There probably should be a second edition to this, as there are somethings I am not going to reveal. See below 71. I am a Scorpio and I am everything they say including secretive. 72. I want to own white sheets one day 73."}

It\u2019s now widely recognized that transformation is a pre-requisite to their survival and growth. Business organizations in India especially public enterprises are experiencing winds of change. For the HR function, there could not be a more existing and challenging opportunity than managing the complexities of change and transformation. HR today is playing a lead role along with business functions in creating the necessary momentum and internal capabilities. This project seeks to capture the value of \u201cSynergizing HRD Interventions for Growth\u201d covering the ideas and experiences like Changing Business Scenario and HRD Challenges, Organizational Transformation  and Restructuring, Managing Performance and Productivity Enhancement, Managing Diversity, Developing Learning and Training Capabilities and Aligning HRD to Business. HRD Interventions in Developing Global Competitiveness Today all are aware that it is the era of globalization and competitiveness. Right now the issue is not only of global competitiveness but local competitiveness. Till now, Indian industries have been so protected that it is not concerned about the emerging competition. These organizations today need to ask themselves where they are and where they need to go. Today\u2019s passwords should be competition for both survival and growth. To meet the new challenges, however, some of the organizations are planning well. As far as organizational planning is concerned Indian organizations are capable of planning well but regarding training and HRD interventions they are not performing too well and don\u2019t even give much importance to it. Normally everyone in the organization undergoes training. But to meet the emerging challenges and issues, organizations need to upgrade or modify their HRD interventions, or more specifically training interventions. NTPC is one of the few PSUs where attempts are being made to plan training interventions and a serious thought has been given it to make training a systematic method. Benchmarking HRD Practices Benchmarking is a method of establishing goals based on industry\u2019s best practices. It\u2019s appositive and proactive process change practices and procedures in a structured fashion to achieve superior performance. Today when there is competition not only within India but the world over, and when one can get all information about product, processes and all management styles in minimum time, there is a need to have better or even international benchmarks. Benchmarking HRD practices may help organizations to develop action plans better manpower planning and developing human resources in amore effective manner to meet the challenges of the new millennium. In order to make the kind of progress that is need to be competitive, HRD and quality professionals have to work in consonance with each other. It is one of the problems faced by many organizations. Why are things the way they are and what could be done to achieve a positive change? The 2 approaches to this problem have been followed since the early part of the century.

I was at first afronted with news of the CA race, (it is just SO important to us in LA, isnt it?) but a quick scan provided links to each of the major candidates websites. Id finally hit pay dirt... YES! Other than the list of names, there were no stories, not even the one about qualifying. So, Ive since systematically reviewed each candidates website. Issues are presented in a variety of ways: from the non-existent and general to the concrete and detailed. Some candidates assume their audience is grossly uneducated in comparison to themselves, thus addressing their constituants as such. Others take the time to present their ideas concretely in a manner that can be understood by all. Ultimately, I think many of our candidates are laughing at us behind our backs. Why are a vast majority of our citizens uneducated? Because they are treated that way -- Stupid is as stupid does. I am scared for this state if every person reacts to the Jay Blossman ad... Oh, I know him... I saw his commercial, lets vote for him because I dont know anything about anyone else. Blossmans issues came off as extremely lofty and arrogant. He addressed a large number of issues, including some controversial things like abortion and 2nd amendment rights. His arguments were trite and obvious in their aim to merely gain the conservative votes of the state. He is purposely playing the right keys, such the good little politician, to get the votes he needs, not stating issues he actually believes. I doubt he has the ability or the integrity to lead the state in the direction it needs. I was impressed with Lt. Governor Kathleen Blanco. She organized her issues is an excellent manner, going from the general, abstract ideas of education, economic, and healthcare reform to more specific, action plans for each issue. She most definitely has more experience; she has been second in line for 8 years now. Her ideas are more realistic than most other candidates because she has a better understanding of the what and how of accomplishing change within state government."}

Breen  11/18/2002, Volume 008, Issue 10   Every Midget Has an Uncle Sam Costume  Writing for a Living  by Donald Bain  Barricade, 239 pp., $22.95   Murder at Fords Theatre  by Margaret Truman  Ballantine, 326 pp., $24.95   A BIZARRE PHENOMENON first observed in the 1940s became a crime-fiction epidemic by the 1990s. Famous entertainers, athletes, and presidential relatives began sitting down at the typewriter to bang out mystery novels. Or so they would have us believe. In truth, nearly every one of those celebrities made a deal through an agent or book packager, collected a nice advance for the use of the name, and left to a professional ghostwriter all the actual writing. Ghostwriting is a time-honored practice, and most readers surely realize that movie stars and baseball players have help with their memoirs--just as all politicians these days have help with their speeches, campaign literature, and policy statements. But the dissemination of novels that are ghostwritten seems somehow more blatantly deceptive and ethically questionable. Look, for example, at the new memoir by the veteran ghostwriter Donald Bain, who has written, under his name or others, some eighty books. In Every Midget Has an Uncle Sam Costume, Bain entertainingly describes his experiences as an officer in charge of censoring American Armed Forces Television in Saudi Arabia, as a jazz musician, and as an airline public-relations flack in a happier and more free-wheeling era of air travel. But the most intriguing topic in the book is ghostwriting. Bains first major success, Coffee, Tea, or Me? (1967), presented the comical amatory adventures of two stewardesses who appeared in public as the authors, Trudy Baker and Rachel Jones. Three sequels followed, plus similar faux first-person accounts of nurses, office temps, teachers, and actresses, always with attractive young women recruited to front the books for publicity purposes. Bain also wrote the autobiography of actress Veronica Lake, crime fiction signed by the actor David Toma and the ex-cops Nick Vasile and Mike Lundy, and the Murder, She Wrote novels in ostensible collaboration with Jessica Fletcher, the fictional character played on television by Angela Lansbury. Theres no doubt that readers can be extraordinarily naive. About the cover photos on the Murder, She Wrote books, Bain reports, one fan wrote in to say it was amazing how much Angela Lansbury looked like Jessica Fletcher. But when the ostensible author is a real person--and the book itself is a novel--readers dont seem unreasonable in expecting that the person whose name appears on the cover actually wrote the book. Employing a ghostwriter on a work of fiction is never more dubious than when the putative author really is a writer. Brett Halliday (creator of Mike Shayne), Leslie Charteris (creator of the Saint), and Ernest Tidyman (creator of Shaft) all turned to ghosts to carry on the exploits of their famous characters. The Ellery Queen team employed other writers to turn out paperbacks that were very different from the genuine Queen novels."}

Famous entertainers, athletes, and presidential relatives began sitting down at the typewriter to bang out mystery novels. Or so they would have us believe.

Ghostwriting is a time-honored practice, and most readers surely realize that movie stars and baseball players have help with their memoirs--just as all politicians these days have help with their speeches, campaign literature, and policy statements. But the dissemination of novels that are ghostwritten seems somehow more blatantly deceptive and ethically questionable. Look, for example, at the new memoir by the veteran ghostwriter Donald Bain, who has written, under his name or others, some eighty books. In Every Midget Has an Uncle Sam Costume, Bain entertainingly describes his experiences as an officer in charge of censoring American Armed Forces Television in Saudi Arabia, as a jazz musician, and as an airline public-relations flack in a happier and more free-wheeling era of air travel. But the most intriguing topic in the book is ghostwriting. Bains first major success, Coffee, Tea, or Me? (1967), presented the comical amatory adventures of two stewardesses who appeared in public as the authors, Trudy Baker and Rachel Jones. Three sequels followed, plus similar faux first-person accounts of nurses, office temps, teachers, and actresses, always with attractive young women recruited to front the books for publicity purposes. Bain also wrote the autobiography of actress Veronica Lake, crime fiction signed by the actor David Toma and the ex-cops Nick Vasile and Mike Lundy, and the Murder, She Wrote novels in ostensible collaboration with Jessica Fletcher, the fictional character played on television by Angela Lansbury. Theres no doubt that readers can be extraordinarily naive. About the cover photos on the Murder, She Wrote books, Bain reports, one fan wrote in to say it was amazing how much Angela Lansbury looked like Jessica Fletcher. But when the ostensible author is a real person--and the book itself is a novel--readers dont seem unreasonable in expecting that the person whose name appears on the cover actually wrote the book. Employing a ghostwriter on a work of fiction is never more dubious than when the putative author really is a writer. Brett Halliday (creator of Mike Shayne), Leslie Charteris (creator of the Saint), and Ernest Tidyman (creator of Shaft) all turned to ghosts to carry on the exploits of their famous characters. The Ellery Queen team employed other writers to turn out paperbacks that were very different from the genuine Queen novels.

Bain also wrote the autobiography of actress Veronica Lake, crime fiction signed by the actor David Toma and the ex-cops Nick Vasile and Mike Lundy, and the Murder, She Wrote novels in ostensible collaboration with Jessica Fletcher, the fictional character played on television by Angela Lansbury. Theres no doubt that readers can be extraordinarily naive. About the cover photos on the Murder, She Wrote books, Bain reports, one fan wrote in to say it was amazing how much Angela Lansbury looked like Jessica Fletcher. But when the ostensible author is a real person--and the book itself is a novel--readers dont seem unreasonable in expecting that the person whose name appears on the cover actually wrote the book. Employing a ghostwriter on a work of fiction is never more dubious than when the putative author really is a writer. Brett Halliday (creator of Mike Shayne), Leslie Charteris (creator of the Saint), and Ernest Tidyman (creator of Shaft) all turned to ghosts to carry on the exploits of their famous characters. The Ellery Queen team employed other writers to turn out paperbacks that were very different from the genuine Queen novels. One case of posthumous ghosting, Chains of Command (1999)--credited on the cover to William Caunitz, who died in 1996, but written almost entirely by Christopher Newman--precipitated a class-action suit by readers who believed they had been defrauded. Celebrity mystery novels, like other ghostwritten books, differ in the way the actual writer is or is not credited. In the most honest method, arguably not ghostwriting at all, the celebrity makes the writing professional a full collaborator, as in the recent Blue Moon, signed in equal-sized print by bandleader Peter Duchin and Edgar Award-winning novelist John Morgan Wilson. The second method doesnt admit the ghostwriters existence to the world at large but at least tips off others in the writing and publishing trade. Many of the novels attributed to Star Treks William Shatner credit in the acknowledgments the assistance of science-fiction humorist Ron Goulart. Actor George Kennedys paperback mysteries offer thanks to Walter J. Sheldon. A more subtle variation is to dedicate the book to the real author, as actor George Sanders did for Craig Rice and Leigh Brackett, the authors of the two 1940s crime novels published under his name. (Bain used the same method to give himself credit on the Coffee, Tea, or Me? books.)   The third method is for the celebrity mystery to eschew the slightest hint of a ghostwriters presence.

He writes, I later used what Id learned as the basis for a crime novel I went on to ghost for a well-known person. The plot of Trumans Murder on Embassy Row (1984) involves caviar smuggling. Recognizing that the ghosting of fiction presents a greater ethical dilemma than nonfiction, Bain asks, Is a book buyer cheated when buying a novel not written by the person whose name appears on the cover? Is it fraud? I dont think so, though my bias is understandable. Perhaps his bias is, in fact, understandable--but he goes on to add: In most cases, the consumer gets a lot better book than if the nonwriting collaborator had tried to do it solo. This will not do. The book is sold on the premise that a celebrity wrote it, and there is no excuse for such a pretense other than deceiving the consumer. Still, one might ask, wheres the harm? The journeymen writers doing the actual work undoubtedly realize more profit from being celebrity ghostwriters than they could from novels under their own names. The idea that the inflated money the celebrity and ghostwriter get would otherwise go to more deserving but less famous professional writers is clearly specious. The deceptiveness of attributing a book to a person who didnt write it is minor next to the credits for doing nothing that feature in many major motion pictures. And what does the deceived reader care, if the novel is a good read that appears to draw on the celebritys area of expertise? THE ANSWER IS that there are several harms. The books, more even than most commercial fiction driven by the marketplace rather than the artistic impulse, are rarely good mystery fiction. The celebrity publicity machine attracts readers that might otherwise be drawn to better books. While the big advance might not have gone elsewhere, some of the bookstore display space, public-library buying, and newspaper review attention certainly would. The public impression that anybody can write a book erodes the professional respect accorded to real writers. And finally, in the unlikely event a celebrity author actually writes a novel, no one in the cynical book world will believe it."}

Anyways, Amir and Hector grappled one day and he made Amir tap like a typewriter, or so I hear since I didnt witness it. Amir himself told me Hector was trying to kill him. (You tap out in wrestling / grappling when someone has you in a hold and you cant get out of it - its usually accompanied by a lot of pain when force is applied!)  I dont really know how to describe Hector - hes not very tall but he is a walking heap of muscle, his upper body would put most bodybuilders to shame. Think Ken Shamrock people... (http://www.webcom.com/collectr/wr/images/wpshamrockk.jpg) but bigger! So yes hes strong, but this guy has got impeccable technique. I swear he was wiping the floor with me but without using any strength. Hes quick as hell too, I squirmed out of some of his holds but hed just have me in another one before I could think! He nearly choked me out on the last one too."}

No one really minds if youre not giving 110% during class and you dont have the army-style discipline in karate that a lot of the pressure comes from (unless Shihan takes a kickboxing class, but thats a rarity these days). My usual partner during kickboxing is Martin, whos been teasing me lately about fighting John Halford a lot. Now you see, John Halford is an AWESOME karateka and kickboxer - hes never lost to another Australian in karate competition and his record is like 80 wins, 3 losses. Im not sure about his kickboxing record, but he does hold a world title in some category under some organisation. He was fighting in the Nationals where I fought at last year and was in the open middleweight (brown / black belts), which he won for the 6th straight year, and I was in intermediate middleweight (yellow / green belts). Ive since graded to brown belt in December and it doesnt take a genius to figure out whose division Im in this year. The stuff he (Martin) says is quite amusing really. After I had gone through a sequence of some 160 kicks (blame Tony, our trainer), he said, Thats it, Joel! John Halfords shaking in his boots now!

Yes I feel good now after training; maybe its the endorphin rush, maybe its the fact I survived Hector, but I guess there really is nothing like a good training session to make the world alright again."}
