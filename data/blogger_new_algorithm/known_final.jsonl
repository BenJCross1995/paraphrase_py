Obviously, I know that everyone who viewed that program immediately rushed over to the internet to find out who screamed that godly Woo! You know it. &nbsp;  Did anyone else crack up when that black guy on 99 said it took him four or five times to understand  The Sixth Sense ? Mmmm. I could live forever off of that stuff. &nbsp;  I watched  The Big Lebowski  today. For the first time. I know, I know, its horrible. Not the movie, the fact that it was released in 1998 and right now it is 2004. Goddamn, that is my kind of movie. Just a long, nonsensical, and lazy&nbsp;yet complex&nbsp;plot and John Goodman rambling about his experiences in Nam. So so funny and unique. And I almost cried. Seriously, after they dumped out the ashes and Dude yells at Walter for all the Nam references and Walter just hugs him... damn. I want to make a movie like that. I just want to make movies. &nbsp;  What happened to that dream? My dream of being like Brendon Small and making a bunch of movies? Ill tell you what, it died, because I lost interest. I mean, I still really want to do it, Im just not creative enough right now to write anything. I had that one script, and I think it was funny, but I lost interest and didnt find it funny after playing around with it so much. For the longest time, Ive just wanted to direct a movie to see what it feels like. I think I could do a good job at it. Hmm. &nbsp;  But like I said in a conversation with Kit, I dont have the persistance to make anything bigger than a sandwich. &nbsp;  Oh shit! Speaking of Home Movies, Soup2Nuts is releasing a three disc DVD set of Home Movies on November 13th. This is very, very good news. &nbsp;  What the hell? They played part of the chorus of Denis Learys Asshole, song during 99, except they bleeped out the word Asshole. So all you hear is  BLEEP oo-ee-ooo-ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oole! So stupid. Why put it in there if theyre just going to bleep it? VH1 needs to lower their bleep usage. Like during the South Park part, when Chef said  BLEEP  on my Chocolate Salty Balls. Put em in your mouth and  BLEEP  em. You guys, God, the song is about a tasty salty chocolate snack. He is talking about eating his wonderous product that he slaved over in order to make some money. It is not some lude reference to oral sex. Christ. Get your minds out of the gutters. &nbsp;  Haha, I said that the black guy  slaved  over his food."}

I need to make some small changes to it but for the most part its pretty much finished. Faith the Size of a Mustard Seed Faith is a very important factor in a Christian\u2019s life. Turn to Matthew 17:20 it says this: \u201cAnd Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.\u201d  It\u2019s as simple as it seems, which may not be simple at all. It may seem impossible to you to move a mountain. That is because you don\u2019t have faith. Just having partial faith won\u2019t work but you need to have a full amount of faith. If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, nothing is impossible for you. Mountains will move in your life. Then you\u2019ll move mountains in other people\u2019s lives as well. Turn to Philippians 4:13 it says this: \u201cI can do all things through Christ which strenghtheneth me.\u201d When you say this statement you have to have faith. If you have God in your life and you have faith all things are possible for you. Turn to James 2:20 it says this: \u201cBut wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?\u201d Here works is talking about actions. If you have faith that God is alive then put that faith into action by going and spreading the word. An example of this is in James 2:26. Turn to James 2:26 it says this: \u201cFor as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.\u201d Is your spirit dead? Are you struggling spiritually? Get into God\u2019s word. Trust in Him. Turn to Mark 16:16-18 it says this: \u201cHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover.\u201d  Talk about extreme faith!! God will reward you for your faith but trouble will come if you don\u2019t believe. You will have power if you believe and have faith. You\u2019ll cast demons out of people and they\u2019ll be filled with the Holy Ghost. You will be covered with the blood of Jesus. He will protect you. God will use you as His tool as He heals people. Wouldn\u2019t you like to have that kind of faith and those rewards to follow? The good news is you can! Just believe and have faith. One of the greatest healing evangelists Kenneth Copeland has ever known came up to him and said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand it. I have prayed for more than 2 million people."}

My trip to Egypt has solidified my belief that first and foremost, I am a filmmaker. I dont think there is anything that I enjoy as much as the filmmaking process. Although the Egypt production was pretty low budget, I could totally see myself doing a combination of ethnographic/social documentaries as well as fictional narrative films. I think that one part could finance the other. Now I just need to find a way to finance film projects on a continuous basis. Going the academic route is certainly one possibility. There is something to be said about being in school for 9 months and then applying for a grant to shoot for another three months. I would just need to find an academic program that would allow me to combine the two. Im not much of a cultural anthropology guy, but if thats what it takes, I may go that route. The other route would be to concentrate on one comparative area (say the Middle East or Latin America) and enroll in an academic program that focuses on a variety of socio-political and economic issues from the said area, and then apply for grants to shoot films in that area. I suppose that another academic route would be to go for the MBA, specialize in entrepreneurship, and use that academic foundation to open up a production company that combines the academic documentaries along with narrative fictional projects. Thats the strongest possibility right now. I need to start writing to admissions officers to see how I could structure such a program. Another thing about going back to school is that it would certainly allow me to take off to Europe for a summer and take some courses. I really really love Madrid; I think its absolutely great. I could totally do Barcelona or Salamanca for a summer semester and then head out to other European cities on weekends and breaks. On that note, perhaps I should consider London School of Economics. Thatd be a quick way to get to Europe and do the academic thing at the same time. Hmmmmmm. Need to see how this is all going to work. So many thoughts running through my head, but for the first time in a long while, I am beginning to see a semblance of the path that I need to take in order to make it all happen. Weird  as Im writing this, my iPod is playing a song by JET called Move On. First few lines  Well I been thinkin bout the future / too young to pretend / its such a waste to always look behind you / you should be lookin straight ahead. Yeah, Im going to have to move on / before we meet again. -  Mia, your music taste rocks. MBA  production company  documentaries  film projects  creative projects  photography  graphic design. I think my resources (in terms of networking, personnel and personal skills) are at a point where I can make it happen."}

As you enter Antalya you are greeted by a sign that says Altitude: 30. This 30-meter difference between sea level and the city is the height of the cliffs on which it is built. These cliffs, which set Antalya apart from other coastal towns, are 13 kilometers long and from 30 to 50 meters high, a sight well worth taking in for the visitor. And the easiest way to enjoy the cliffs from up close is to make a short trip by sea. To do that, its enough to go down to Antalyas oldest harbor, now called the Yacht Harbor, and cock an ear for the boatmens call Selaleye gider To the waterfall! And after your boat leaves, filled with tourists from a variety of countries, all you have to do is lean back and let your eyes wander. On this boat trip you will have a chance to see not only the cliffs, every square meter of which is a natural wonder, but also a number of points that dot them. urlLink       For many decades, Antalya families who wanted to sun themselves and swim would come down to these tiny beaches, which are interspersed among the cliffs like so many oases in the desert. Especially popular was the locale known as the Kadinlar Hamami The Turkish Bath For Women where women came without having to travel too far from town to enjoy the sea and summer in perfect privacy. AN UNDERWATER FEAST FOR THE EYES   As they carried underground and surface water to the sea, these cliffs were also home to a number of facilities designed to exploit this flowing water for human use. Mills and power plants, for example. Literally gushing forth, the water would turn its energy into flour and electricity before going on to reach the sea. Thus it would bid farewell to the cliffs after providing humankind with bread, that basic food, and electricity, an indispensable element of civilization. These buildings are no longer used in our day. But there are other places associated with the cliffs, still in use and a must to see. urlLink       Natural formations in the rocks continue to serve as chambers and storage space for various diving schools. Remember, diving along the cliffs is quite different from diving out at sea. Down to 20 meters or so the cliffs form a reef, and with their living organisms are a feast for the eyes. Of course one should also mention the submarine caves. It is not every holiday that offers the experience of swimming underneath the restaurant where you ate last night, or the nightclub where you danced. THE ENCHANTING SONG OF DDEN   Just as we were thinking the vacation would not be complete without breakfast in one of the parks that top the cliffs, suddenly we began to hear that amazing sound."}

Who cares how a little girl views people? See those ants over there? They\u2019re more than a billion of them, and I\u2019m the one all the way to the right next to the ant carrying the moth. I am just one of billions, and according to the people around me, I\u2019m a scary freak with nothing better to do with life than sit in corners. So now I\u2019m out of the corner, and does anyone really care? Probably not. But I\u2019ll make the best of it. To start off, I\u2019ll start talking about people in general. They think, \u201cThat person has a black shirt on, they must be bad.\u201d Or \u201cThey don\u2019t believe what I do, they must be evil.\u201d Just because someone does what he or she wants and not what everyone else thinks is \u201cnormal\u201d that doesn\u2019t make him or her a bad person. If you come up to them and say something nice to them, they won\u2019t pounce on you. Come up and bad mouth them, then they\u2019ll fight back. But of course, people are people and they fear difference. Why is that? Because the idea of a perfect \u201csociety\u201d is one where everyone is the same. It will not work, however. You cannot take a group of people and make them all the same; human nature is to rebel against that sort of thing. No one can suppress this nature. So then why do people try to? Why do they bother? Because at the same time, people also have a nature of being scared of other people not like them. Although, some can overcome this nature, more so when someone is older but sometimes he or she cannot get over the fact that not everyone is exactly the same. And they don\u2019t have to be the same. This is where therapists come in, these professionals tend to try and change someone for the better of the whole. Although, I won\u2019t be so stereotypical as to say all are like that. Some even encourage difference. But some just won\u2019t get off your back. Anything that doesn\u2019t seem right to their perspective must be changed at all costs, doesn\u2019t matter what the person thinks. And if something is wrong, they have a pill for that. Cover up sorrow with a happy pill; people shouldn\u2019t learn to deal with the fact that he or she will be sad at times. Once again, not all are like that, but I can\u2019t help to notice this fact when people talk about mental health and therapy. Therapists are paid to \u201ccare\u201d; I\u2019d rather talk about my problems with someone who cares about me and not their paycheck. Arrogance is a huge problem as well. All the school kids are laughing at people from other countries. Why? Because they sound funny."}

While there I found some great stuff, including an awesome kitchen table with a reversible top for card playing and a bumper pool table BUILT IN! How amazingly awesome is that?! True, its not like a foosball table, but um...you cant play Euchre on a foosball table! The whole deal cost $600, but that included 4 rolly chairs and the table, plus the cues and pool balls. I just priced it out online, and no one seems to come close to that price. So...I may go to SticksNStuff tomorrow and buy it. urlLink   Zoinks! Somebody stop me. Im OOC with my money this weekend. I also bought a cool zip-up sweater from H&M. Its red, white, and blue and it only cost me $13 (originally $26), so Im already starting to buy for New Yorks autumn. This goes along with the great deals I got on Wednesday -- slate gray corduroy pants ($45.00 discounted to $9.77), a knit green polo ($45.00 discounted to $9.77), an awesome Havana shirt (long sleeve, navy blue, very thin cotton, and open at the neck -- $36.00 discounted to $11.99), and a very cool 1950s style button-down short-sleeve shirt in red with two thick white stripes running along the buttons ($40.00 discounted to $9.77).

If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it  is mans number. His number is 666. Revelation 13    Prologue  What does the mark mean? What is the significance of 666? What does it mean? To answer all these questions, I will critically interpret the history of this two thousand year old mystery. This symbol generates great curiosity among many people and volumes of works have been written on it. In fact, the Google search engine pulls out 2,950,000 entries for \u201c666\u201d! This further indicates the depth of the subject matter. It is also noteworthy that the symbol has been abused and read into to promote unhealthy and non-Christian theology. In this paper, I will argue that the number of the beast, 666, is merely the name of the beast and not a magical number of any kind. I will show that John indeed identified the mark (666) with the beast for he clearly states that the mark is the name of the beast. Therefore there is no need to read the text backwards starting with the mark in order to identify a certain beast\u2014this is the eisegesis I will argue against. In Search of the Beast   The symbol 666 has been misinterpreted and misused for millennia. I will now survey some of its most significant misuses. Many people, like Gary Blevins1, believe that the mark will be an invisible laser tattoo injected under the skin or a microchip that will be placed under the skin for scanning at the point of trade. Such people ignore the fact that the original audience of the book, for whom Revelation was written, understood what John had communicated to them. Therefore, since lasers and microchips were virtually unknown 2000 years ago, this \u201cinterpretation\u201d should be discarded. Other people like Blevins are literally obsessed with the number 666 and look for names that match them to identify the beast. Needless to say, such people can get stockpiles of names like the one Blevins2 mentions in his book, Ronald Wilson Reagan! It is interesting, though, that Ronald and Nancy Reagan are still haunted by this number. The Reagans retired to a house in 1989 at 666 St. Cloud Road, Beverly Hills. Nancy had the address changed to 668!

Sorry its been so long since Ive last dropped a post, time does fly! Anyway while Im enjoying my stay here in Puerto Rico I would like to get to the bottom of a  question I have. First of all the basketball team down here I am able to practice with until I know if I can play or not (long story but basically its all about needing residency and if I can slide with just coming to visit ever since I was little every yr or if I officially have to be here for a year to qualify to play) has been real cool. Talk about small world but I just happen to be playing with a girl who I was play against in college. Her along with one other girl both are from the states so immediately it was just natural to bond with them first. The one who I played against in college is real cool and pretty much goes with the flow like I do. The other player is coo as well a bit of a different style somewhat keeps to herself and sleeps a whole lot but she can be down to earth as well. For most of last week I was able to stay at their place a couple towns over since practice was right around the block from them. Eventually to complete the beginning stage of me getting to know them ..I had to find out the question every female athlete has to another when they meet someone......are you gay? Ha yes unfortunately for all us female athletes out there the sterotype for us being gay is definitely growing. I would say 1 out of every 4 women athletes are gay...however Wnba probably has a different ratio of probably 1 out of every 2 haha yup sounds about right! So to make a long story short one of my teammates I was staying with who I found out was gay convinced me and her other roommate who is straight to go to the club with her. My first response was hell ya I havent shaked my ass yet in Puerto Rico since Ive been here but then I put two and two together and realized it probably was a gay club...in the end I agreed I would go since the night we were going is open to everyone and plays really good music. So how was my experience to my first gay club......ummm I guess it was o.k. The first 40 minutes I had a blast since no one was really on the dance floor and  the three of us pretty much made our american mark with our style and dance moves..that was fun! As the time was ticking more and more people came on to the dancefloor..I would definitely say it was more gay men on the dance floor shaking their ass but there was still the hand full of girls dancing as well."}

But what happens when a person finds a problem within themselves? When they\u2019ve finally gone through the agony of looking back at themselves and discover a problem, what do they do? I guess it would depend on the problem, and the person. For example, if someone were to figure out that they have a drug addiction then they might commit themselves to a rehab center, but if another person were to discover that they were compulsive liars, they might just continue on with their issues, possibly feeling guilty, but nonetheless continuing. Reason I bring it up is because I have my own problems, and I full well acknowledge them, but I haven\u2019t changed every one of them. I used to have problems with abusing the internet for various reasons and I changed my ways, finally growing up and seeing that what I was doing was wrong and immoral. So in that instance I\u2019ve changed. But in others, with a lot of my other problems such as: not speaking up, holding back emotions, not watching my words (such as \u201cwhatever\u201d), and there are more I may touch on later. With the first, not speaking up, I have a strange dilemma with, well, it may not be strange but it is a dilemma either way. So far, it has not put a huge dent on my life, there have been times where if I had spoken up I may have succeeded in something I otherwise took the back seat in, or it just plain would have been better had I said something, or said it louder. There was one situation where I could have missed out on the love of my life, but due to the incredible friends I have been so graciously gifted with, all was not lost and I get to share my heart with the most incredible person in the world, something I thought might not ever happen. But other than the prior mention issues, I have not had huge consequences on my inability to speak up, therefore I have not tried to change it. Lately though I have been coming to the grave realization that if this does not change I will not be able to move into adult life correctly. I can run a business, and have it be the most successful one in the world, I\u2019ve somewhat proven that in my journalism work, but the problem is getting there. In school, you can become acknowledged in basically one of two ways, through being loud about yourself, or by being recognized for diligence. My situation is the latter, I got where I am through what I have done, and it should work that way throughout the world, but unfortunately it does not. In the real world I have to network, talk to the right people, make the right connections, or else I\u2019m going no where. If I can\u2019t make contacts and just rely on my workmanship, I won\u2019t get where I want to be."}

Well maybe not but this is the first new update in a while. It all started after taking 3 of my 4 in car driving lessons with a real stickler named Norm. He sucked so I was really looking forward to driving with the \u201ccool\u201d guy named Steve. So Steve pulled up to my house and I got in the car at 5:00. I knew right away that this in car would not be like the others. Steve asked me what I listened to and then turned up the volume on 100.7 WMMS. As we pulled out of my apartment complex, Steve said, \u201cyeah, just go wherever you want, we\u2019ve got two hours to kill.\u201d  I was like ok whatever, turned left, and kept going strait down Ridge rd. for like 20 minutes. By this time Steve was getting bored and complaining about driving for 2 hours for no apparent reason so we turned left again onto Route 6 I think. After that we took the REALLY long way to Lakeland Community College where I had to do maneuverability. So I did the whole test twice and Steve was talking on the phone with Bruce the whole time. So after I do it twice perfectly Steve hangs up the phone and says, \u201cMan that Bruce is such a little chatterbox.\u201d  So he\u2019s like you don\u2018t have to do this thing anymore if you don\u2019t want to, your good enough to pass anyway. Then he says he wants to go over by a tree to have a smoke. I\u2019m thinking ok whatever he\u2019s gonna smoke and then we can go drive around some more and go home. Steve gets out of the car to have a smoke and he tells me I can drive around as long as I don\u2019t wreck the car. So I\u2019m driving around in this car when I only have my temps and Steve is standing there smoking. It would have been an awkward situation if I would have crashed in the Drivers ed car without a Drivers ed teacher in the car. I didn\u2019t crash though and I went back and picked Steve up. When I get him he\u2019s on his cell phone again and he\u2019s talking to someone and telling them that he had the best driver he\u2019s ever seen in the car. Well I\u2019d say he\u2018s in the top 3 and I can\u2019t even remember the other 2 is what he said. So after that we are pulling out of the parking lot and we see Norm pulling into the parking lot at the same time so Steve Honks the horn at them and yells HEY NORM. Less than a minute later Steve was honking at the campus cop and then we were on the road again. So by this time it\u2019s almost time to go pick up the next person who was driving after me and we go to the gas station to fill the tank up before we get on the freeway."}

Actually, it wasn\u2019t that bad, there was just a lot of stuff to pack. On the other hand, though, my mother told me that I could go through the boxes on the shelves against one of the walls and sort out what I wanted to keep. This was a good thing. This was a very good thing. Apparently both my mother and my aunt haven\u2019t been entirely on top of things, then again my grandparents had a lot of things they\u2019ve gotten over the years to sort through, and being the inquisitive person that I am (i.e. a professional snoop/researcher since I was four) I made a number of finds they missed. The first was a black faux fur coat that had been stuffed away. It looks like a cross between a wrinkled velvet blanket and a teddy-bear skin gone wrong but I liked it, must be my grandmother\u2019s side of me poking up. Come to think of it, if I was leaning that way in my thoughts, I would have said that the spirits of my grandmother and grandfather were guiding me in a way, or at least bludgeoning me because I\u2019m the only one in the family who apparently pays attention in a half-assed sort of way. You see, aside from the coat, I also found five boxes of L.P.s (yep, good old vinyl) of all kinds of music, although most were of a classical or operatic nature...which means they had to have been my grandmother\u2019s. Add to that, I found three boxes of sheet music and old books on music, and I do mean old! There are more than a few that will need to be re-bound, and one of them had the date of 1909. The above two things were important because music was very important to my grandmother. For most of her life she had been taking singing lessons and was very, very active in the music community here in St. Louis. Both an opera and a night club singer, she was one of the hands that built an opera company here in the city, as well as for a time had a night club called The Lorelei\u201d in Gaslight Square (a very ritzy, night-club area of town in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s). To say she was a character would be like saying that a diamond was just shiny. She was a big woman, both in height and personality, a real grande dam. Among her possessions was a navy blue dress studded with a wide swath of rhine-stones around the collar and cuffs. I won\u2019t tell you how many shoes she had specifically because I\u2019ve never bothered to count, but she loved shoes, and being the only member of my family with big enough feet to fill them, what my aunt didn\u2019t take for her remembrance, I inherited, and there were a lot!"}

Disclaimer: The below post ended up being dreary. It wasnt meant to be. I was able to chat to my dearest friend who lives in Portugal. S moved to Portugal after highschool and is now completing a degree in Architecture. She is coming to Australia with her beau for Christmas so it will be nice to meet her and her man. We both return to Sydney a few days from each other in December - should be nice. The only thing is that S can be too intoxicating. Over our chat I was reminded of a argument we had when we were 14. S has always been demanding - for everything. Friendship, attention, listening, dancing, and gifts. It isnt an evil thing - just in equal amounts she is generous and caring. And I totally love her. But even today I was reminded of this fact when she tapped away in our chat  I should take the time to remind you to bring me a gift from the States. She was probably 1/2 joking, no a 1/4 joking, but the insinuation was still there and reminded me of the time she badgered me about a birthday present weeks and weeks before the actual event. I always felt compelled at the age of 13 - 18 to buy her expensive presents - I dont know why. Looking back she would have remained my friend either way. It baffles me to be honest. So this one time I actually started saving - which was hard as I didnt have an after school job, and I came from a single parent house hold with a parent who was paying for private education for two kids, paying a mortgage and still trying to provide the absolute best for her kids. But still I tried to save and with her birthday looming her badgering started to pick up, until a few days later I totally blew up. We were in class, Commerce Studies. She was asking me questions about what I had bought her. I still hadnt purchased anything. There was a silver ring I thought shed like, but the store didnt have lay-by and I hadnt saved enough. So after a million questions and me avoiding the questions - I blew up and told her off. I think I even threatended to hit her - thats how mad I was. I was asked to leave the room (That kind of behaviour is not tolerated in this school). Damage was done. We didnt speak and I never had to buy the present for her because of that."}

I get myself in lots of trouble with my husband, because he always assumes that I am trying to tell him that hes wrong... which isnt necessarily true, at least not a majority of the time. I just like arguing! Its hereditary; you should see my brother and I go at it. Over the past few weeks, months even, Ive been boiling to spout out some good rants on US politics in general. I think Ive done a fairly good job of containing my diatribe. Besides in a courtroom, I doubt anyone sees more argumentation or rhetoric than a politician. Have you listened to these people lately? On one side we have the jackass democrats (AKA: Poor, suffering whiners) who are in this almost comical attack mode as of late against the arch-enemy, the never forgetful elephant Republican Party (AKA: Five-year-old elitests). Each side has attempted to make appealing arguments on all variety of issues, from important to the mundane. What have I heard? Nothing but logical fallacies. Lets use the War on Iraq as our example today. First the democrats have a point, albeit a weak one. The current Republican generic justification for the war is what is called an  Ad hoc  logical fallacy, which literally means after the fact. Remember the story: we were going to Iraq to protect our country from WMD, but since we havent found WMD the war is still justified because Saddam was an ass. Yeah, Saddam was an ass when we started the whole affair, and his internal legitimacy as a leader was certainly questionable and more than enough reason to wage an offensive war. In other words, whomever decided to argue for this war in the first place made the mistake of using the wrong evidence. Tell me if Im wrong, but arent we taught from grade school up to verify the validity of our evidence (facts, research, whatever you want to call it)? I digress. So a few people made a big boo-boo from inside the Bush administration; and, whether they were the culprit or not, someone has taken the blame for the mistake... kind of. Should be the end of it right? But of course not, this is America after all. Nope, we instead get blessed with mounds and mounds of whining which have simply boiled down to  Argumentaum ad hominem  -- argument against man. Mr. XYZ and his colleague Mr. DCB arent to blame for this mess, the entire Republican party is to blame because they are a bunch of idiots, just like their idiot Texas president."}

Dreams, as another general rule, are equally ill-equipped to deal with the present; and with reality, for that matter. The former thinks mostly about the past; the latter, about the future and the what could be. Im a historian and a dream, therefore, Im uniquely designed to think about everything except for this moment right now. Which is rather amusing, really, considering I usually advocate a philosophy of live for the moment. Its one that I try to follow, but I also constantly think about what was and what could be. Im a study in contradictions, I guess. The way I think about the past is probably not unique. I have a certain amount of nostalgia for that which went before. Im more enamoured of the music that was made before I was born than I am of the crap theyve got on the radio today. Im fascinated by the way politics and religion and philosophy worked in the distant past, back when what one believed was more important than money. I also think of the past in more personal terms, recalling the joys and sorrows Ive shared with those I love over the years. I long for those moments from the past, to relive particular days, or hours, or even minutes of such pure bliss that the rest of the world ceased to exist as far as I was concerned. I remember first kisses, telling someone I loved them for the first time, the laughter of a friend as I changed their bad day into a good one. I remember the tears I shared with friends over loss, heartache, suffering, and just the random stupidity of life and an uncaring, random world. Yes, my musings on the past are rather wistful, and just a touch bittersweet. Sweet because so many of my memories are good ones, and so much of the more general history Ive studied academically is interesting and fascinating to me. Bitter because I know the personal memories are just memories, and I cannot relive them again, even if I am with those people once more. No, time marches on, of course, and nothing I can do--especially wishing--will change that. Also bitter to think that so many of the stupid mistakes our ancestors made are repeated on a daily basis, because we didnt study what came before us and thus cannot understand that these conflicts we keep fighting are not going to be resolved with a show of force and a taste of steel. The way I think about the future is maybe a bit odder, though even it is probably not unique to me. I am, as I said, a dream. I dream of what could be, of what will never be, of things real and imagined. I dream of the day when I become a professor in history, or even of the day an acceptance letter comes from one of the schools I applied to arrives in the mail."}

By now youve probably heard at least a little something about the Libertarian party. Libertarians have had a Presidential candidate on the ballot in all fifty states for the past three election cycles, and the Badnarik campaign is well on its way to making this years election number four. We have candidates running for local and state level positions all across the country, and currently boast over 600 Libertarians in public office. Many people are even aware that the Libertarian party is the third-largest political party in American politics. In spite of all this familiarity, the one question that many people still seem to have is, ``What exactly is a Libertarian??`` People with conservative beliefs often see us as ``liberal`` because of our outspoken defense of personal freedoms -- like the freedom of expression, or the freedom for peaceful adults to decide what to eat and drink, and how to raise their children. On the other hand, people with liberal beliefs tend to see us as ``conservative`` because of our staunch defense of economic freedoms, including the freedom for people to trade with one another in a way that they decide is in their own best interest. These misconceptions say more about the prejudices of the people who hold them, than they do about the Libertarian perspective. Despite all the confusion, the Libertarian philosophy is especially easy to understand. Libertarians are, quite simply, people who believe in ``Self-Ownership``: I own myself, and nobody else on Earth has a higher claim to my body or my labor than I do. Likewise, we have a deep respect for other peoples` self-ownership: You own your body, and so long as youre acting in a way that doesnt interfere with anyone elses freedom, you should be free to do what you please. The idea of ``Self-Ownership`` is what is what distinguishes us from both liberals and conservatives. Every political position that Libertarians take can be traced back to this simple idea. For example, Libertarians are opposed to ``liberal`` attempts to use the government to regulate people`s buying practices by imposing tariffs on certain goods and industries. We oppose this kind of regulation not because we think that all goods and industries are equally wonderful, but because we believe that people own themselves, and can decide what to buy based on their own beliefs and values. If for some people that means buying fair-trade coffee at the local co-op grocery store, then thats great -- just as long as they don`t use the government`s power to force other people to do the same. Likewise, Libertarians are opposed to ``conservative``attempts to use the government to regulate peoples morality, by imposing laws that restrict their behavior on the Sabbath, or at the pharmacy, or in the bedroom. Were opposed to these kinds of legal restrictions not because we think that all lifestyle choices are equally worth pursuing, but because we believe that people own themselves, and can decide how to live their lives as they see fit."}

Thursday - Had a training session with Shihan and Michelle (whos also going to NZ) and it was a complete change from the day before, had lots of zip and my technique was a lot better, especially on my front kicks. Shihan and I did a run down to the chemist to pick up some supplements to help with my energy levels and the healing process. Friday - Didnt do as well as on Thursday but training was quite different, lots of basics and little sparring. While on as physically demanding, it still is challenging fitness wise, actually I dare say even more so! Oh yea, and Shihan kicked me in the privates while demonstrating a technique. He didnt get me in the jewels, which usually makes you feel sick; instead, he got me on the top of my member and suddenly had this burning sensation I never quite felt there before. (I didnt feel any pain I guess I was in shock!) Thoughts rushed into my head like, Im bleeding! MEDIC!!! But yea my gi didnt turn red or anything, so it was all good. It was scary for like a minute or so while waiting for the burning to subside! After training Shihan and I went over to Chris place for dinner - hes a close friend of Shihans and also trains with us at the dojo. His mom was over so she cooked a big meal (typical greek, cooked for 3 but enough to feed 5-6 people!) and we watched a DVD after. It was 12am by the time we left so I crashed at Shihans for the night. Saturday - Had a bit of a lazy morning, Chris came over to fix a leaky pipe in Shihans bathroom and we sat around and chatted for a bit. I headed off about lunchtime back to Penrith and rested in the afternoon before going to Meys bday thing at Darling Harbour. Made my way down to the city and took me ages to find parking, which redeemed public transport for me once again (despite its crapiness). I finally met Alan (as in fellow Bruneian, Alan) and despite what Mey and Sheryl seem to think, I dont see any sort of resemblance or qualities about him that mirror or resemble me in any way. Oh well, I did only just meet him so I guess I should reserve any final observations for now. The Shelbourne was... um, interesting I guess. The DJs werent much good and it wasnt just my opinion from observing the looks of bewilderment on the faces of people on the dance floor as the RnB DJ transitioned from song to song. The retro DJ didnt fare much better, he wasnt even transitioning between songs. He was also greatly annoying me with his overuse of the technique of pulling down the music to let the crowd sing along."}
