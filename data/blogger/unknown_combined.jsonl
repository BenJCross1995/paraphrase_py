Bright said:  My sister is anorexic/bullemic and weighs less than 100lbs - she looks scary, and we worry so much about her - when I went to France to interview my surgeon who eventually performed the wls, he was asking about my family history - I told him about my sister, and he said you are both exactly the same - it is the same illness, establishing itself in different ways.... I was watching some old video the other day of me about 2 years ago, at my top weight of 330lbs, and I was shocked at how awful I looked, not just vanity wise, but all puffed up with a sheen of sweat on my face... straining to walk around Disney World.... I was really angry watching that from the perspective of 80lbs lighter - where the hell were my family/friends at that time? Nobody ever took me aside and said hey, you are going to die young here - can I help you fight this? Everyone rallied around my sister and begged her to get help, literally moved mountains to help her - I never thought anything of this other than, she has a serious problem and Im just stupid and fat. It is way more politically correct to be anorexic/bullemic than MO, if you know what I mean. I talk a lot about being MO these days - talking to family/friends about the reasons I got so overweight, and they all kind of turn away, and find the subject a litte distasteful, as if I was sharing too much intimate information....."}

While the Poinsett Tire and Auto guys were doing their thing, I took the opportunity to run a few miles in an area of Greenville I dont usually run. Just one of the benefits of running: exploring. As a matter of fact, there are a ton of benefits to running. Let me give a few examples.... My benefits from running:  -Logging only a few miles seems to release a flood of serotonin to my brain. -I tend to eat healthier, eat more often, and never feel guilty about giving into my food cravings when I run. -When I feel strong physically, I feel strong emotionally as well. -Running demands strong abs and strong muscles. Thus, I tend to make ab workouts and weight-lifting, both important for your health regardless, a part of my routine. -I sleep better. -Alone time. Its a good time to think a lot or not think at all. Running is the best way to get good ideas, life answers, clarity, and a sense of balance and peace. I dont care what people say about yoga, running is my zen. -Or, it can be a social time. Some of my best friends are running buddies from various cities. Ask anyone who has a running buddy and they will tell you, theres not another friendship like it in the world. -Exploring new places. The main things I remember about Sacramento, CA and Phoenix, AZ are the runs I took there. -An appreciation for rain."}

Between phones, the computer, and checking in members while handing out towels, Im learning to multi-task like a five-ring circus with the occasional rampant lion or elephant. You see, if theres one thing Ive learned is that people on the whole, or at least those at the Y, are genrally good, patient, and if theyve got a problem or a complaint then they say so in a civil manner and thats that. Then theres the occasional lion-elephant, and even then those creatures are more docile than these&nbsp;two members whose tempers exploded this past week. Let me start by saying that at the front desk of the YMCA, the people who work there are pretty much the communication center of the building, but they are not the ones who make the decisions in regards to how the building and programs are run. That is for the administration to do, simple as that. So when theres a problem with the placement of the equipment in the fitness center, or some machine isnt working right, then we pass the information on to the appropriate person and they address those particular issues.&nbsp; Almost all the members at the Y seem to understand this, except for a couple, who if they do understand it, completly ignore it and rant like ill-mannered three-year-olds throwing a temper-tantrum because they cant get what they want. Interestingly enough, those ill-mannered three-year-olds throwing temper tantrums of late have been&nbsp;grown adult men, of which only one I have faced, and thankfully someone else was there to intercept him."}

But here we are in Phoenix, Arizona enjoying an evening hike without a care in the world. Except me....my thoughts are on these survivors of the Bataan Death March. My legs were tired from my run, but I tried to imagine what these men went through on that 68 mile hitch-in-hell, indeed. If the dysentery or thirst didnt kill them, the Japanese soldiers did. They beheaded or shot anyone who stopped or fell down. Heartbreaking. Could I survive something like that? I wondered. These men write about how they had a strong will to survive. They made up their minds early on that they would survive. They had the will to live. After the march, they were imprisoned and beaten. Then they were shipped (literally) to Japan on a death ship. If they survived the horrific conditions on the ship, then they were sent to a POW camp where they were forced to work in a coal mine....for 3 years. I made my way to my Jeep and sat there for a while. As I drove home, I thought about these fine men and all they went through. One guy went through it all dreaming of when he would return to his wife. Unfortunately, after he returned home he was told she had remarried."}

I made my way to my Jeep and sat there for a while. As I drove home, I thought about these fine men and all they went through. One guy went through it all dreaming of when he would return to his wife. Unfortunately, after he returned home he was told she had remarried. Imagine that!! So sad. So, my hike that night was a time of deep reflection and thanksgiving. I am thankful to God for His mercy. I am thankful to all the soldiers who experienced World War II and served so bravely. And I am thankful for all who served our country in all its wars and at peacetime (my dad and uncle, my bro-in-law, my brother,...my husband). I am especially thankful for our soldiers and Marines serving in Iraq and Afghanistan at this moment. For what they are going through, and for what they will go through...but mostly for  urlLink  what they have done  , I am truly thankful. Like World War II or the defeat of the Cold War.....we may not see all the positive results of a free Iraq for many years now. But the point is, we will see the  urlLink  results. As I made my way into our apartment and heard the blessed voice of my young son welcoming me home, I walked over to my husband and hugged him."}
