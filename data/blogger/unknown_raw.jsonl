Thats way early, For the record, my vacation has been filled with days where Im getting up really early, which after a night of shooting/partying, is really fun, I must say.  So we get over to AUC to meet with the students. We jump in three separate cars and head over to the outskirts of Heliopolis. The plan is really simple: we head to a meeting point where we will meet with Norhans dad, who will then lead the way over to the construction site. If only simple things could remain simple in Egypt.  So we get to our meeting point to wait for Norhans dad. He gets there, and we begin to follow him. Four cars. Norhans dad is leading the way. Well, our driver (an AUC provided driver) decides to pass Norhans dad. Why? I have no idea. Another AUC driver does the same. Now, John and I are riding in the back seat, talking with Jan, who is riding up front. Were not really paying attention to whats going on  were assuming that our driver can do is prescribed job of following the car in front of him.   So about 25 minutes later, the other AUC driver zips up next to us and flags us down, letting us know that weve passed the exit.  (Mighty considerate of him, to do so  otherwise we might end up all the way in Sharm.) So we need to make a U-turn, which is not as simple as it seems because the highways in Egypt arent designed like they are back in the states. The next exit/U-turn is like 10 miles down the road. So we make the U-turn and come back to another exit about another 5 miles beyond the exit that we missed so we can make another U-turn. We do so, get off on the exit, and then stop. We dont see anybody. So we ask the other driver if he saw where everyone went. He didnt. He just saw the exit that he knew we were supposed to get off on, so he flagged us down. This led to about an hours worth of confusion. We call Norhan, who is with her dad, to see if she can give us directions. She cant, because she has no idea where we are. (Oh yeah, did I mention that streets in certain parts of Egypt dont have names? That makes it way easy to figure out where you are.) So we jumped back on the highway, looking for another exit. We literally drove back and forth (in 10 and 5 mile increments) making u-turn after u-turn, trying to get off on the right exit. So it turns out that after we passed everybody, they passed us again and kept going. So we never passed an exit where they had gotten off. We finally made it to the construction site about and hour later (after one of the girls jumped back on the highway, found us and led us back to the site.) Needless to say, Jan was less than pleased with this whole incident, but John and I (partially because of sleep deprivation) thought it was hysterical.   Filming on the construction site was fun. Lets just say that construction standards in Egypt are just a little different than in the US. The girls had a fun time climbing up an inclined plank (not attached to anything) that led from the ground level to the second floor, where the workers were building part of the second floor foundation. Fortunately, a nice breeze kept us relatively cool  it was probably only 100 degrees, but the wind made it feel a little cooler. The lack of humidity helps. I think by this point, I have grown so completely comfortable with sweating profusely that I dont even notice it. We got some really good shots at the site that I think will help show the girls personality. They really have fun in almost any situation. They dont really complain about anything  they just joke about it.   Afterwards, we went over to a caf/restaurant to get some lunch. I ordered a virgin pina colada in the hopes that it would cool me off. It wasnt too good, but it did cool me off. John and I picked up the lunch tab for the class  we figured it was the least we could do for them for letting us follow them around nonstop for two weeks.   John and I came back to the apartment, where we crashed for a bit. Even though it wasnt sweltering at the job site, the sun does have a way of just draining all your energy. Slept just enough to barely refresh ourselves and then headed back to AUC to film a dance performance by Selma. AUC is hosting a Model Arab League and their opening ceremony features some introductory speeches as well as some performances. Selma danced with two other girls to a traditional Egyptian dance track. Out of the three, she was definitely the best dancer  mainly because her on-stage presence was really strong. She really enjoyed the dance. Afterwards I asked her about it, and she explained that she had been dancing for years, but had to quit because AUC stopped offering dance classes and because she couldnt pursue it professionally.  I had wanted to go to the pyramids by night w/ Nahla, but she cancelled. So I stayed in for a bit, then headed out to Cairo Jazz (where at this point I am definitely a regular) to meet up with Yasmin and her mother for some drinks. We bumped into Shirine from Campus over there  she was hangin out with Ammar, one of the owners. There was a live jazz band playing tonight at Cairo Jazz (obvious, you might think, but it is only the second time Ive heard a jazz act here.) The drummer was absolutely incredible. He had a solo pretty much every song, and he totally deserved it. Really solid performance. John and Yasmin know both the lead guitarist/singer and the bassist, and we chat with them a little bit during one of their breaks. Its really true what everyones told me about Cairo  in the upper class circle, everyone knows each other. This has its benefits and its disadvantages. In a society where external pressure and judgment are ever present, I can see how it can be totally annoying to see the same group of people when you go out. At the same time, I think its pretty cool that you can go anywhere, see someone you know on some level and pick up a conversation from where you left it off last week, last month or even last year.

{"id": 463289, "author_id": 3492066, "gender": "female", "age": 34, "topic": "Student", "sign": "Cancer", "date": "25,July,2004", "text": "   As Terry Pratchett once wrote in  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy , 'Time is an illusion, lunchtime doubly so.' Although time goes in one direction, it is truly elastic, expanding&nbsp; to too much when it is not needed (say in a dentist's chair, or worse, in a meeting), and contracting to too little when you really want it (when was that report due?).  Time for me is a rubberband, and occasionaly it ricochets out of control off the floor, the ceiling, and the nearest human body (the cats have the common sense to get out of the way).  To sum up in a hopefully painless way, work has kept me busy, my mother has kept me busy, and my cats have made it clear that the bed I sleep in is actually theirs, and that I'm just borrowing space they'd rather not give up.  Working at the YMCA has been enjoyable, interesting, and far from boring. Between phones, the computer, and checking in members while handing out towels, I'm learning to multi-task like a five-ring circus with the occasional rampant lion or elephant. You see, if there's one thing I've learned is that people on the whole, or at least those at the Y, are genrally good, patient, and if they've got a problem or a complaint then they say so in a civil manner and that's that. Then there's the occasional lion-elephant, and even then those creatures are more docile than these&nbsp;two members whose tempers exploded this past week.  Let me start by saying that at the front desk of the YMCA, the people who work there are pretty much the communication center of the building, but they are not the ones who make the decisions in regards to how the building and programs are run. That is for the administration to do, simple as that. So when there's a problem with the placement of the equipment in the fitness center, or some machine isn't working right, then we pass the information on to the appropriate person and they address those particular issues.&nbsp; Almost all the members at the Y seem to understand this, except for a couple, who if they do understand it, completly ignore it and rant like ill-mannered three-year-olds throwing a temper-tantrum because they can't get what they want.  Interestingly enough, those ill-mannered three-year-olds throwing temper tantrums of late have been&nbsp;grown adult men, of which only one I have faced, and thankfully someone else was there to intercept him.  Look, it is one thing to air ones grievences, to say that there's a problem and give suggestions as to how you'd like it fixed, especially asking if there is a particular person you need to talk to about it.&nbsp;It is another thing to rant, rave, and attack people who aren't even there, let alone a whole body of people. It's even worse when it's done to people who have no control over the situation let alone any say.  Just last Wednesday (and I was thankfully not there for this) a man came in at 6 p.m. wanting a basketball. One of the ladies behind the service counter informed him that the gym was currently in use by the Wednesday Basketball League, and that the entire court was being used until 10 p.m. that night. And so she warned him as she went to get him a basketball&nbsp;that he might not get a chance to play. Oh, the man threw a fit spouting that he was a doctor and a member and that he knew the head of the company whose name graced our building&nbsp;(which, although it's the name of our building, it only means that they sponsored the building of it), and that he wanted a basketball, that we weren't giving him one, and he kept repeating that he was a doctor and a memeber like it would get him special treatment or that he was far more intelligent than the people behind the desk.&nbsp; After about twenty minutes of this tirade, he went on down to the gym, and as one of the managers (and administrator) put it shot off a couple of 'granny-shots' for a few minutes until the league nudge him off. And it didn't stop there, he called up to the desk from the lockerroom demanding to speak to the manager, as that the manager, a woman, had answered, she said that she was indeed the manager. No, he said, he wanted to speak to the manager, he wanted to speak to the man. The only man on duty that night, a really laid-back guy by the name of 'Tom,' was handed the phone, the poor guy, and heard a whole rant on how the doctor had been fond of basketball and playing basketball since he was a small child, and how just holding the basketball would allow him to learn things and that the women up at the front desk were loathe to give him a basketball. As the doctor left, he grabbed a piece of paper, wrote down everyone's name including the manager (whose first name he kept mispronouncing), and even asked Tom's name, who looked at the guy and asked 'What did I do?' since he had not been in the middle of all of this. Then the doctor stormed out.  Well, Dr. Pang has no doubt already received his letter from the head of Membership Services saying that although we are there to serve his needs and help him, we are not there to take that kind of behaviour, and that such abuse is unacceptable. Oh, yes, and there were witnesses to his tirade to say the least. One fellow was sitting at a table in the lobby just shaking with quiet laughter, while a newly married couple asked the doctor's name (after he had gone down to the locker rooms) so that they knew who they absolutely didn't want as their physician in any aspect.  Yesterday, and I thank heavens for having the co-workers I have, a fellow came in at 9 a.m. asking why there couldn't be any pool lanes open at that hour (there are swim lessons and water aerobics at that hour attended by our senior citizens and our youngest members with their parents), and he went on ranting about how he spent so much money for a family membership and that his son couldn't go down to play basketball during the day because the day-camp took over the gym until 6 p.m. To leave it at that would have been one thing, but then he added something rather intolerable. He went on to rant, 'What is the&nbsp;YMCA doing, trying to squeeze out every last dollar possible? They're turning this building into a nursery. Meanwhile, his son was out playing basketball in the 100 degree heat.' At that point he wasn't there to rant or complain, he was there saying 'Me! Me! Me! I want! I want! I want!' and&nbsp;he was getting absolutely no sympathy or understanding from me. Frankly, I was about ready to tell him that if he felt that the membership was not suiting his needs that he could cancel his membership, and if he had bought the full year package we would gladly refund the balance.  As I said before, thankfully my more experienced co-worker was there as that she partially placated the man, as if he could be placated, as he walked through the doors into the main part of the facility (where he was going, I don't know, as that he felt he couldn't swim).&nbsp; We were going to have him speak to the manager on duty, but I don't know if this ever happened as that we were supposed to snag him on the way out. Hopefully my co-worker saw him leave and got him as that I didn't.  Other than that, I really enjoy seeing members come in. The children of all ages are an absolute hoot, lots of energy and lots of fun. Our senior citizens, whom I enjoy calling 'silver foxes' are people I greatly admire. They have so much energy, so much spunk, even our 90-somethings! A few of them look so frail, but they are up and moving, and getting out to socialize and all that, things that my grandfather didn't do.  A side note here as I write, if I seem to be meandering off it's only because I'm being talked at by my significant other who has a gift of rambling like a brooke in flood. I love him, but he doesn't quite understand that I can't hold a discussion very well while I'm trying to write (which gets rather infuriating if I'm trying to do another entry for the story/novel/series/tome I'm co-writing).  Right, so, my mother's now moved into her new (to her) home out in the 'country,' nearly half-way between St. Louis and Hannibal (or at least somewhere on the way). I spent days earlier this month packing, and got off work early to help out with the movers to take stuff from the house and put it into one of the four storage lockers she had rented; she had to move out by the 12th, but the new house wasn't ready until the 20th. And again, I helped her, the eight movers with the four vans, move from the four lockers to her new home on the 21st.  I've got to say this, I'm already nestling comfortably into the thought that the new house in Moscow Mills is now the family home, and some place I can live should the need arise.   Now I've just finished being told the events for the entire last episode of  Stargate: Atlantis , although I never asked for the information.  Anyhow, back to my mother's new home. It's a 10 acre plot of land with a two-storey house with a finished basement making it a total of five bedrooms, three baths, an office area, a large kitchen, dining room, living room/sunroom, family room, and a storage room. There's an above-ground pool in the backyard, a playhouse for the kids, and two small storage sheds. There's also sotrage space in the attic which is sorely needed considering all of the stuff moved. Note: this is a combination of my things, my mother's things, and things inherited/received after my grandparents' deaths. The neighbor on the left has two horses, the neighbor through the woods on the right breeds and raises dogs, and my mother's going to raise alpaca's and use their wool.  Oh, yes, and there's a small cemetary at the back of the property. Unfortunately, the grove that its in has become overgrown, and I can only see one pillar-type burial marker, but only from a distance at which I can't read it. Although some folks would possibly get creeped-out by this, for me (and my mother too, I think) and my sister it's a sign that this is a good land, and that we're blessed to have the privilage to care for the burial ground. Yes, while some would think of ghosts as being bad things, we consider it good. And a small cemetary means that whomever was buried there had lived there, and that they were so well loved that they were buried close to home. That's the important word 'home.'   Speaking of which, I need to get myself together and head out that way with Lloyd. Although my mother's sleeping at the moment (she works night shift as a nurse at a local hospital), I had told her that I'd be coming out this weekend to mow the property because it needs it badly! That and I'm kind of hoping that I can get a picture of the cemetary, and&nbsp;start making plans on how to clear it out enough undergrowth to tend to it properly, and keep the wildflowers!  I know it sounds strange, but when my mother told me about the cemetary, I went straight out to see it (of course! I am the curious one after all). She said it was fenced in, but I found that the fence was only on one side, and that there was a cut pathway around the back (someone had mowed a path for the surveyors a couple of weeks ago). Aside from seeing the single-pillar stone (kind of like an obelisk), I saw a number of wildflowers and a huge black and gold butterfly. It also struck me as to how sweet the air smelled. It was absolutely delightful.  Now, if only I can keep journalling daily. I shall endevour to make it my goal to do so.  "}

I just spent the last hour blogging and I lost it all! GRRRR!!! I am so annoyed.  Let's see if I can remember what I had so eloquently put in the other one.  Here I am in Rome. It's AWESOME. I love this place. I love the scenery and I cannot wait to see more.  Paloma, Julien, Anton and I ended up at the pub we went to previously. Lorena, do you remember the one we went to on Friday night? That one. We had a few drinks before heading back where we said our goodbyes. Our numbers were dwindling and it was obvious. Only hours before I had said my goodbye to Isabelle, whom like Cristina had been with me since I first arrived. It was like saying goodbye to family. However I am confident that we will see each other again, if not in Paris, definitely in Sydney. Right Isabelle? I'll wait for you and Ludavic.  Getting back to my room that night I wassomewhat nostalgic. This room that I had made into my own the last weeks, have become HOME. As close to it as I was going to get. It had been transformed from a scary small room, to mine.  At 3:45am I stood at the door and let my eyes take one last glance. From the study table where my momentos from home lived, my pictures tacked up, to the lumpy, squeeky, suspiciously unchanged bed, (well it has been changed, but the frequency remains suspicious) to the bookcase I had filled up with my toiletries, kitchen stuff and what not, to the washer basin and mirror that was too high to ever really see the extent of how badly you looked in the morning. Not to mention the suspicious hole that was directly above it. One's mind could do wonders. But anyways...  At 4:00am my Mini cab arrived promptly and I made it to Victoria in plenty of time for my 4:30am Gatwick Express. After the formalities at Gatwick I waited patiently for my plane excited at the prospect of going to Rome. Wow! Excited didn't even come close. Without any sleep from the night before, it doesn't need to be said that I passed out completely the moment I sat down on the plane. The old couple beside me were quite amused that I had managed to sleep through the chaos of the children around us.  When I arrived I was met by Grace's cousin Kuya Ferdie (another one), and not long after Annie and co arrived. After a long train ride home, and a trek uphill to the flat, we basically collapsed into a heap at the flat. Some of us, not mentioning any names *aherm* passed out till the following day. And it wasn't me. We had Pizza for dinner. Welcome to Italy!  We rose early the next morning and left early, excited for the day ahead. But first there was their trip to Greece to arrange, and unfortunately because of the frequency and length of travel to Greece, they had to leave a day early. So once all that was sqaured away we did our very own version of SPEED TOURING. Since they had to leave the following morning.  The day was awesome despite the rushing around. I loved being with them. It reminded me of the weekend away trips with my friends. Jeanette and I will always have that Espresso shot and 'only only only' to bond us for life.  First we went to the Vatican, and unfortunately the Pope wasn't around. I guess he didn't get my e-mail to meet us. Or at least wave from the window. From there we went to Piazza Navona, we tried the Sistine Chapel but it was closed by the time we got there. We then went to the Trevi Fountain, and as promised I threw 3 coins in. From the Trevi I think we went to the Pantheon. It was after the Gelato for sure but I'm not sure if that was after the Trevi. =) At the Pantheon Annie, Jeanette and I experienced another fit of the giggles. We pretty much decided we were a bad combo that way. Though to our defense, it's not our fault we see amusing things all at the same time. After the Pantheon, we went to the Spanish Steps, where we lost Dan. We didn't realise he was exactly where Annie and Jeanette had left him behind the steps. We attempted to make it to the Colloseum, but when we got there it started pouring and the sky was darkening. So after a few photos, a couple of more laughs we headed for Kuya Ferdie's for dinner. His wife Ate Len Len was extremely nice, and at the risk of making Ate Grace jealous, Arin is soooo cute. He has the roundest cheeks. It was getting late and we still had a long way home so at 10:30 we headed home. Caught the tram, then the train, then we had to change trains, at midnight we literally crawled uphill and then collapsed when we arrived home. Unfortunately for them, they were leaving early the next day, so they crashed as soon as they got there.  Saying goodbye was sad, even if we had only spent a couple of days together. I guess they were a piece of home I wasn't so ready to let go off just yet. But...cest la vie. (oops wrong country) After they left the house was like a tomb. It was so quiet.  I did a little grocery shopping, then familarized myself with my immediate surroundings. This morning I cleaned up a little and did my washing before heading over to the centre to do some local exploring. Tomorrow I want to hop on a tour bus and perhaps do the Colloseum all day on Monday. The possibilities are endless...after all I am in Roma.  I am uncertain as to how long I'll be here before heading back to London. We'll see. Cristina called me the other night and she is returning to Florence this weekend so hopefully we can meet up somewhere and catch up soon.  Anyways...best go see the outside world. Take care...  Love lots.... MUWAHHHH!!!          "}
{"id": 566677, "author_id": 3579704, "gender": "female", "age": 37, "topic": "Arts", "sign": "Aries", "date": "05,August,2004", "text": "   I went hiking last night up a small mountain here in Phoenix: North Mountain.  When I write, 'last night' it sounds like it was dark, but at 7pm there was still plenty of sunlight.  I ran up the mountain's paved road and did some deep thinking, as I usually do when I am running. I think that is why I love to run so much! My husband doesn't understand how I leave as soon as he gets home to go 'run up a mountain'. After spending all day with my 9 yr. old son, I need and crave the solitude.  Anyways, the mountain is a smaller one, but it is a tough run. The inclines are pretty steep at times and just when you feel like your lungs and legs are about to explode, the road becomes straight and you get a break before the next hill.  My thoughts were on the books I just finished reading:  urlLink  'My Hitch in Hell'   and  urlLink  'Bataan'   . Both were written by survivors so you get a first-hand account. I've tried to read books by historians and their thoughts on Bataan, but I just can't get into them knowing that the author never even served in the military.  As I was huffing and puffing up the next hill, I thought about what these men went through.....many of them enlisted to beat the draft so they could choose where they wanted to serve. They had left jobs, family, and the effects of the Great Depression behind them with hopes of serving for year or so then coming back to the US to finish college and get on with life. Most were in their 20's.  When these men landed in the Philippine Islands, they had no idea what was about to happen to them. Their real life accounts were over shadowed by Pearl Harbor. Indeed, I had no idea that Japan attacked Clark Air Field the next day! The Japanese were pretty much drained after the Rape of China and needed the P.I. and other Pacific Islands. The Commander of the attack assured his Emperor that the P.I would be Japan's after one month.  It took 4 months.  Our soldiers in the P.I held off the Japanese even though they were suffering from dysentery, malaria, and starvation. Why were they weakened by these factors? Because FDR ordered MacArthur to leave the P.I and head to Australia and regroup. So, MacArthur left 75,000 US soldiers and Filipino soldiers alone on the islands with only the food and medical supplies they had with them. No reimbursements were coming.  After four months of fighting, the remaining generals were ordered to surrender. It would be the first surrender of American forces in our nation's history. The Japanese took all the leftover food supplies, medical supplies, and ammunition.  As I huffed and puffed up the mountain, I thought about these poor soldiers. Imagine if that happened now, today, in Iraq.  All our soldiers and Marines are left behind by their commanding officers with only the food and medical supplies left on the bases and nothing else coming.  Then, imagine our President ordering these soldiers and Marines to surrender to the insurgents (or 'revolutionaries' to Michael Moore...) as the US commanding officers are in Turkey regrouping and planning the attack.  If you think the insurgents and terrorists who beheaded the hostages are bad....then you need to read about how the Japanese soldiers treated their POW's...namely, our US soldiers.  The Japanese had tried all their torture devices and methods out on the Chinese and had pretty much perfected them by the time they met up with our soldiers in 1942. Many of the authors stated that they had heard about the Japanese urlLink   atrocities   in China and were very scared about surrendering to them. But they had no choice. The fact that they had surrendered made many of the survivors feel like losers. There were no parades for them when they got home.  So, as I make it to the top of this small mountain and watch a summer storm roll over the city of Phoenix. I am in awe. Arizona has some fantastic Summer storms because of all the dust in the air. These dust particles reflect the light of the sun and make some spectacular sunsets. As the large dark blue clouds roll in, they cover the sun as it tries to set and the rays of the sun force their way through the clouds. The rays stream down over the city....like the glory of God.  I sat on this bench that is on the top of the mountain. (It was dedicated by the family members of a local artist who died young.) As I sat on the bench, my thoughts turn to CBFTW, Kevin (Boots on the Ground), Chris Missick, Blackfive, and Major Bellon (The Greenside) all military and all serving in Iraq.  I said a prayer for them and thanked God that these men have not been abandoned over there. Their Commander-in-Chief will not order them to surrender. They will not have to be tortured by their enemy without a fight. They will not have to work in POW camps anytime soon and pray for their next meal to come. Don't get me wrong, they are indeed in harm's way....there is a real enemy out there who want these fine men dead.  I sat and thanked the Lord for these men who are willing to volunteer and fight for their country. It left me in awe again. I prayed for their safety and for God not to remove His hand of protection over them. I asked God for a hedge of protection around their bases, the IP police stations, and our embassy. The privilege of prayer is not taken for granted by this hiker.  I looked around our city and took in the cool breezes. A cool breeze in August here in Phoenix is a gift of God. They are few and far between.  I am a better person for having read about these soldiers who survived one of the most horrific events in World War II. As painful as it was to read about one being hanged by his thumbs for 2 days followed by his testicles for another day....after being beaten for an hour by the Japanese, it has to be read. It has to be written about. I have to tell others about it. These men wrote their stories so others can read them and learn from them. I am a better person for having read many of the soldier blogs everyday. Their stories must be read and treasured as well.  I made my way back down the mountain and passed families making their way up. I passed some women talking on cell phones as they hiked down. I eaves dropped on their conversation about school and grocery shopping. I passed one elderly man on his way back up the mountain for the 3rd time! He had to be about 68 yrs. old and he was running up the mountain for the 3rd time that evening!! Amazing. I passed a woman walking her dog (poor dog..) up the mountain.  And I think: how blessed we are that this War on Terror hasn't affected us in the slightest.  Imagine the President telling us that we have to ration gasoline, sugar, steaks, and COFFEE. Imagine Starbuck's reaction to that one! Imagine us in 2004 using ration stamps to buy meat. The ACLU would be all over that! This country would go into shock.   But here we are in Phoenix, Arizona enjoying an evening hike without a care in the world. Except me....my thoughts are on these survivors of the Bataan Death March. My legs were tired from my run, but I tried to imagine what these men went through on that 68 mile 'hitch-in-hell', indeed. If the dysentery or thirst didn't kill them, the Japanese soldiers did. They beheaded or shot anyone who stopped or fell down. Heartbreaking.   Could I survive something like that?  I wondered.  These men write about how they had a strong will to survive. They made up their minds early on that they would survive. They had the will to live.  After the march, they were imprisoned and beaten. Then they were shipped (literally) to Japan on a 'death ship'. If they survived the horrific conditions on the ship, then they were sent to a POW camp where they were forced to work in a coal mine....for 3 years.  I made my way to my Jeep and sat there for a while. As I drove home, I thought about these fine men and all they went through. One guy went through it all dreaming of when he would return to his wife. Unfortunately, after he returned home he was told she had remarried. Imagine that!! So sad.  So, my hike that night was a time of deep reflection and thanksgiving. I am thankful to God for His mercy. I am thankful to all the soldiers who experienced World War II and served so bravely. And I am thankful for all who served our country in all its wars and at peacetime (my dad and uncle, my bro-in-law, my brother,...my husband).  I am especially thankful for our soldiers and Marines serving in Iraq and Afghanistan at this moment. For what they are going through, and for what they will go through...but mostly for  urlLink  what they have done  , I am truly thankful.  Like World War II or the defeat of the Cold War.....we may not see all the positive results of a free Iraq for many years now. But the point is, we will see the  urlLink  results.    As I made my way into our apartment and heard the blessed voice of my young son welcoming me home, I walked over to my husband and hugged him. I whispered, 'thank you' to him and told him how proud of him I was. He looked at me strangely, but knew what I was talking about. Then he asked what was for dinner. (Typical Marine)  THANK YOU to all who are serving. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU.  Psalm 27:11-14 ' Teach me thy way, O LORD; and lead me on a level path because of my enemies. Give me not up to the will of my adversaries; for false witnesses have risen against me, and they breathe out violence. I believe that I shall see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living! Wait for the LORD; be strong, and let your heart take courage; yea, wait for the LORD!'    "}

I really  did  have too many drinks last night. Ooof, bit of a hangover...but I had a blast so I'll take it.  Now it's time for a serious post. Below is a post on my favourite  urlLink lapband  board and my response. MO = morbidly obese.    Bright said:  'My sister is anorexic/bullemic and weighs less than 100lbs - she looks scary, and we worry so much about her - when I went to France to 'interview' my surgeon who eventually performed the wls, he was asking about my family history - I told him about my sister, and he said 'you are both exactly the same - it is the same illness, establishing itself in different ways....' I was watching some old video the other day of me about 2 years ago, at my top weight of 330lbs, and I was shocked at how awful I looked, not just vanity wise, but all puffed up with a sheen of sweat on my face... straining to walk around Disney World.... I was really angry watching that from the perspective of 80lbs lighter - where the hell were my family/friends at that time? Nobody ever took me aside and said 'hey, you are going to die young here - can I help you fight this?' Everyone rallied around my sister and begged her to get help, literally moved mountains to help her - I never thought anything of this other than, she has a serious problem and I'm just stupid and fat. It is way more politically correct to be anorexic/bullemic than MO, if you know what I mean. I talk a lot about being MO these days - talking to family/friends about the reasons I got so overweight, and they all kind of turn away, and find the subject a litte distasteful, as if I was sharing too much intimate information..... Fat is definitely the last taboo...'   ________________________________________________________________       I said:  'Wow, Bright. You know, I've realised for a long time that being morbidly obese and being anorexic are two sides of the same coin. I'd started to understand that I have a disease that I can't just fix by having more willpower or exercising more or eating a strict diet.... but I never gave any thought to the 'help/intervention' issue until your post. You are so right. I mean, how many after school specials and health classes have been dedicated to anorexia and bulimia? It's been drilled into our heads constantly. It's always on tv, it's always in the news, it's constantly talked about and rallied against.       Where's the coverage of MO? How about an afterschool special about a girl who's so obese her joints ache and she can barely breathe and she's slowly killing herself because of her co-morbidities? I want to see  that  show. I want kids to learn about  that  in health class. If my best friend was anorexic, you can bet your ass there'd be one hell of an intervention. But if she was morbidly obese it just wouldn't be the done thing to bring it up.       I can remember when I was younger (overweight but not terribly so), when I would see an extremely heavy person on a talk show or in the street, saying to my best friend, 'just shoot me if I ever get that big!' Well, I may not need a crane to lift me out of the house, but pre-surgery I was big enough that my weight was keeping me from living my life the way I wanted to. Where was the person who was supposed to keep me from that? Would I have even listened?       It's so taboo to bring up obesity; I know I wouldn't have listened had a loved one tried to tell me I was literally killing myself. But really, is it any different than the way an anorexic person would react to such concerns? I doubt that an anorexic would be particularly open to 'help' from a loved one. But does that mean that you just let her waste away? HELL NO. You risk pissing her off if it means she might get healthy. You get her help, come hell or high water. And even if she hates you for the rest of her life, if she gets healthy as a result, it's worth it.      I don't really know where I'm going with this. I just want awareness for morbid obesity. I want widespread knowlege to replace stupidity and ignorance. I want to know what I can do to start things moving in that direction.'   I have so much to say on this issue I can't even sort it in my head. That frigging mantra, 'weightloss really just amounts to burning more calories than you take in...' is such a FUCKING JOKE. It's a god damned DISEASE, whether the general public wants to admit it or not. Hi, my name is Shana, and I suffer from binge eating disorder. There, are you happy now? Does calling it by its name make it seem more legit? No matter how much I tried to exercise more and eat less, it didn't work. The extra weight is just the symptom of something larger. I think having an actual, physical restraint on my stomach is possibly the only thing I could have done to drag myself out of that mindset. And I am so glad I did it. I never knew before how much I relied on food. I had some really nasty depression after the surgery when suddenly my best friend (food) turned its back on me. Oh, swiss cake roll, you'll never leave me...what? I can't eat you anymore because you make me feel kinda sick? Screw you swiss cake roll! I never really liked you that much in the first place! I'm going to go chill with salad and  then  we'll see who's leaving who! I definitely still have food issues. It's a daily battle. But I'm slowly starting to put food in its place, and it's the biggest accomplishment of my life.          "}

While the Poinsett Tire and Auto guys were doing their thing, I took the opportunity to run a few miles in an area of Greenville I don't usually run.  Just one of the benefits of running: exploring.  As a matter of fact, there are a ton of benefits to running.  Let me give a few examples....  My benefits from running:  -Logging only a few miles seems to release a flood of serotonin to my brain. -I tend to eat healthier, eat more often, and never feel guilty about giving into my food cravings when I run. -When I feel strong physically, I feel strong emotionally as well. -Running demands strong abs and strong muscles.  Thus, I tend to make ab workouts and weight-lifting, both important for your health regardless, a part of my routine. -I sleep better. -Alone time.  It's a good time to think a lot or not think at all.  Running is the best way to get good ideas, life answers, clarity, and a sense of balance and peace.  I don't care what people say about yoga, running is my zen. -Or, it can be a social time.  Some of my best friends are running buddies from various cities.  Ask anyone who has a running buddy and they will tell you, there's not another friendship like it in the world.   -Exploring new places.  The main things I remember about Sacramento, CA and Phoenix, AZ are the runs I took there.   -An appreciation for rain.  Summer rainstorms are my favorite time to run.  Rain on a run is exhilirating and speeds me up a notch.  I prefer the rain to come during the last couple of miles as opposed to the first.  After the rain stops and you start to dry off, the trucks who speed past you through rain puddles are not cool. -Feeling my heart beating in my chest.   -If I am kind of in good shape, I am more confident when I am trying new sports and let's face it: practically every sport is new to me. -Every run that I go on is a competition that I win.  Even when I have to walk half the time, I still consider it a success. -Running is a place to safely store obsessive compulsive tendencies by creating a vast, complicated network of personal running rules....      for example, some of my rules for running:  Why?  I only run when I want to.  I have never been forced to run by coaches or teams so I haven't any negative connotations to the act itself.  I do not comprehend the idea of forcing myself to run.  If I don't want to do it, I don't.  This also means that I have to be in a fairly good mood before I run.  I personally don't take myself on runs to cheer myself up.  That's what chocolate is for.   Eating?  I always eat before running.  It is preferable to eat a well-balanced meal at least two hours before running.  Sometimes a high-protein snack is okay as soon as an hour before and I have recently adopted peanuts as a pre-run snack in the mornings.   When?  The best time to run is early evening.  At that point, I have been walking around all day and my muscles are pretty warmed up and stretched out.  Also, it's a time when my energy level might be waning.  A run is a great, natural, afternoon pick-me-up.   Surface?  The carriage roads of Acadia National Park are preferable over all other running surfaces.  Broad, smooth, and un-paved, these roads also offer some of the most beautiful scenery in the world-as-I-know-it.  Even if there is a sidewalk, I prefer the asphalt of streets.  There's something about the look of concrete sidewalks that conjurs up images of myself in a wheelchair at the age of 35.  I don't really know if there is a huge difference in asphalt and concrete... but in my head there is.  I am neurotic about it, yes.  Distance? Around 6 miles is the perfect regular-length run.  It is not too far but it gives me time to think.  When in good running shape, a five mile run should be the minimum distance of any run.  When in a time crunch, 30 minute tempo-runs can suffice.   Racing?  I am not very fast so 5K and 10K are a little too short for me.  I enjoy building endurance and have the irrational and yet hopeful dream of someday getting the best time in my age group in some little half-marathon.     The key?  Hydration.  If I don't drink enough water, I will assuredly have a terrible run.  Water is my secret to happy running.  Up or down?  Almost always uphill.  Not as hard on my joints and feels great for my quads and gluts.  Stretching?  Always stretch before and always stretch after a run.    See how the rules go on and on?  And believe me, I could continue yet.  I won't but this was fun to write.  Running is on my mind a lot lately.  It's like a companion or a friend or a therapist.  Speaking of little inanimate friends, I have also been thinking of my car as a close companion lately.  It seems like he's been with me for a lot of big moves and adventures.   I love that scene at the beginning of Disney's 101 Dalmations when all of the owners and their dogs look alike.  And then Pongo and Perdita, the dalmations, meet in the park one day, they bring their owners, Roger and Anita, together into a happy little family.  In my head, there's an animated version of Chris's Honda and my old Benz meeting and falling for each other.  Of course, they bring Chris and I together and the four of us go on many misadventures.       Meanwhile, in the real world of astrology:  My horoscope in the Greenville News yesterday predicted that surrounding myself with art, films, books, and good conversation will soon spark a renewed output of creativity.

For 8 blissful days I will be camped out at a beach and, although camping trips have been routine for me over the past seven years, I&nbsp; must admit that I'm tired of overstuffing my little Honda Civic with gear and tying crap down on the roof rack as well. My vacation destination is less than an hour away and yet because my camping compadre is a 7 year old princess I have to pack everything (including the portable kitchen sink). My car has taken a fierce beating because of this. It has gotten to the point now that when our little trips end, I only unpack the tent, air mattress, and porta-potty (yes, her majesty requires a portapotty!). The rest of the goods just stay in the car because of the weekend day trips and evening jaunts to the lake in the hills behind our home. My theory is then that because I have all this stuff in my car, I should allow myself the luxury of a new car. Right? Well......sorry folks but I am going to subject you to my torturous list of pros and cons. Let this be your insight to my amazingly indecisive nature!   First of all let's tackle this princess issue. When I was a kid we were allowed to pack one bag for a camping trips. Being the youngest of five kids I had it pretty good because what ever I didn't have room for, one of the other kids was sure to bring along anyways. My daughter may not have that luxury because I'm not brave enough to have more kids (what if they are ALL like her?!!) but I think she needs to have a couple of boundaries here. One of those boundaries should be the portapotty. Sooner or later the kid has got to realize that germs are germs are germs!!! They are on this toilet or that toilet - they are everywhere. The solution to germs are not avoidint public restrooms but SOAP AND WATER (which coincidentally are much easier to pack than porta potties). Flushing the portapotty out of the car shouldn't be such a terriffic battle (no pun intended!). Than there is the air mattress - I mean COME ON!!! How many kids had this luxury on camping trips??!!!! My parents idea of a air mattress was the patch of ground with the most pine needles - as it should be. Ixnay on the mattressay!!! Than there are the beach toys - granted they ARE a necessity - but the quantity???!!! Lets have one bucket, one shovel and one sifter - and that will suffice. Perhaps I can convince my darling girl to leave the rest of the toys in the store for the OTHER kids!!! Yes, my little girl is going to have to get the tough love session on this next camping trip.... perhaps I'll let her know that either the stuff goes or she goes???!!!!! In all fairness though, I must blame this spoiled nature of her on her grandparents - and trust me, I have every right to lay blame there because they happily accept it!   Next there is the actual mechanics of the car. This is a 10 year old car, that has never missed a major or minor service. The engine is in extremely good condition (it is spared the child's havoc) and give me no cause for worry. With nearly 145,000 miles on it, I'm told by fellow members of the 'Civic Nation' that I can easily get another 100K out of&nbsp;it. The mileage I get out of The Trusty Turtle (this name is due more to the drivers aversion to speeding tickets than the actual car) is far better I know than the mileage I could get out of any new car with more cargo space. The Subaru Forrester has killer cargo space but is a gashog. My wallet doesn't like gashogs and neither does my affection for the environment.   Then there is the money. Money's funny honey. The trick here is that I own The Trusty Turtle. Own as in paid for, pink slip in my name, my first constructive financial commitment! Monthly car payments are something I haven't dealt with in two years and its not something I'm looking forward to ever again! Naturally I don't miss the insurance payments either because I've found that as the OWNER of my car, I can afford full coverage at the same rate as an UNOWNED car's liability only rate. You can't go wrong with that! Seeing as I live in California I would also have to contend with the OUTRAGEOUS registration fees - I'm only paying 45 dollars a year to register the Trusty Turtle and I can't walk away from the diabolical joy I get out of listening to people moan and groan about how much they pay to register their  new  cars.   Those are all pretty decent  pro's  right? Alas, here are my  cons.  They are childish at best, so be aware that I am fully aware of that! First off there is the color. You would think my Trusty Turtle is green or some olive shade, yes? Think again.... its a dull blah red. Not my favorite color. The rear bumper is actually maroon thanks to some crazy lady who tapped my bumer two months into my possession of the car&nbsp;and no body shop has ever matched my flat dull red color. You see, when I bought this car I was driving a practically home made VW bug and it wasn't exactly baby proof - so because I was in a bit of a bind and too stupid to know better I bought the first slightly used Civic I came across - which turned out to be my Trusty Turtle. When I signed the papers I knew I hated the color but I was young and had the grand illusion of painting it (why doesn't anyone ever tell you how much that kind of project costs?). So yes its a nasty color and I hate it - I've hated the color for seven years.  Then there is the dated accessories. While I've improved the stereo system as best I could (I must have my music you know) there was nothing that could be done about the lack of power anything. My idea of power windows came about when my daughter graduated from her car seat - since then power windows is 'Sweetie could you roll 'em down' or 'Brr... roll em up!' Likewise with the door locks although we are now in the 'If they want it that bad they can have it' frame of mind! Air conditioning is a dream of ours...... too frice down the highway in the summer with the windows rolled up so we could actually HEAR the music we are listening too!!!To think we might actually arrive somewhere with our hairdo's intact! Its a princess's dream! Yes, I would love to have a car that had these amenities.   So now I have to admit that sinking myself into a financial cesspool just to have a pretty colored car and power everything doesn't seem really doable. In today's day and age when a girl is living paycheck to paycheck and gas prices are displaying an extreme aversion to gravity - it just doesn't seem logical to bind myself up in those money woes. So instead we will pocket that money we don't spend on a new car. We will polish up the dull red paint, tighten down the old roof rack, and overstuff our trunk with our necessities. The Trusty Turtle has been good to us.&nbsp; The bottom line is that it gets us where we need to go - we just might have to take a little less of us there!   Thanks for reading! Pack wisely and drive safe!!!      "}
