My trip to Egypt has solidified my belief that first and foremost, I am a filmmaker. I dont think there is anything that I enjoy as much as the filmmaking process.   Although the Egypt production was pretty low budget, I could totally see myself doing a combination of ethnographic/social documentaries as well as fictional narrative films. I think that one part could finance the other. Now I just need to find a way to finance film projects on a continuous basis. Going the academic route is certainly one possibility. There is something to be said about being in school for 9 months and then applying for a grant to shoot for another three months. I would just need to find an academic program that would allow me to combine the two. Im not much of a cultural anthropology guy, but if thats what it takes, I may go that route. The other route would be to concentrate on one comparative area (say the Middle East or Latin America) and enroll in an academic program that focuses on a variety of socio-political and economic issues from the said area, and then apply for grants to shoot films in that area. I suppose that another academic route would be to go for the MBA, specialize in entrepreneurship, and use that academic foundation to open up a production company that combines the academic documentaries along with narrative fictional projects. Thats the strongest possibility right now. I need to start writing to admissions officers to see how I could structure such a program.  Another thing about going back to school is that it would certainly allow me to take off to Europe for a summer and take some courses. I really really love Madrid; I think its absolutely great. I could totally do Barcelona or Salamanca for a summer semester and then head out to other European cities on weekends and breaks. On that note, perhaps I should consider London School of Economics. Thatd be a quick way to get to Europe and do the academic thing at the same time. Hmmmmmm.   Need to see how this is all going to work. So many thoughts running through my head, but for the first time in a long while, I am beginning to see a semblance of the path that I need to take in order to make it all happen. Weird  as Im writing this, my iPod is playing a song by JET called Move On. First few lines  Well I been thinkin bout the future / too young to pretend / its such a waste to always look behind you / you should be lookin straight ahead. Yeah, Im going to have to move on / before we meet again.  -  Mia, your music taste rocks.   MBA  production company  documentaries  film projects  creative projects  photography  graphic design. I think my resources (in terms of networking, personnel and personal skills) are at a point where I can make it happen. Just need some venture capital. Make your checks out to Rhinohazard Productions, please. : )   I love the fact that its 9:30 PM over here and still daylight. Been here at this caf? for about an hour, and (partially because of the two espressos that Ive had) I am really enjoying life right now. Its going to be really difficult to get back into the swing of things back home mainly because shooting this film has really made me aware of everything that Im missing out on in life. So many people, so many places, so many projects designed to discover. I know Ive said this before, but this has really been a life-changing project. I think I need to take more time to discover peoples and their societies, starting back home in Miami. I need to do more photography projects, I need to shoot more fun creative projects, and I need to write more. This is just a start, but I can say (and its not the caffeine speaking, I swear) that Im on an incredible natural high right now. I just feel like smiling. Life is really good right now, and I just want to make this feeling last. I think editing this doc will help me sustain it for a few months. But I need to travel again, and soon - possibly a December return to Egypt with my dad and my brother to do some more scuba diving in Sharm and perhaps a return to Cairo and the pyramids. I might also do some more touristy stuff like the museums and such.  I think I might also take an Arabic class. I got to a point in my time in Cairo where I felt comfortable listening to the language  I could recognize words (not necessarily their meanings) spoken in conversation. Reading and writing Arabic are a whole other world  but maybe I could learn. Might come in handy some day. I was able to pick up enough conversational Arabic to take a cab back home. Another fun project. I think if I infuse enough caffeine into my system when I get back home Ill be able to sustain my energy for all these projects. But its so difficult when naps are soooo tempting. Must fight off the urge  at lease for the next three months. Lifes challenges are so hard.  Another thought. I guess one of the unforeseen personal benefits from this trip has been this: In conducting several interviews with each of our subjects over the course of two weeks to arrive at an articulation of their perceptions of their identity and their society, Ive been able to reflect on my own identity and articulate my own thoughts on some of the issues theyve addressed. In addition, Ive been able to branch off from their ideas and construct an interpretation of how I view myself and the society I live in. This to me is the greatest aspect of documentary filmmaking  that in the process of telling the stories of individuals and their societies, I absorb their stories (and the process of recording them) into my own personal history. So vs a vs the documentary process, I continuously reflect on my own identity and further define who I am as an individual. I cant think of any other way to learn about other people and their cultural nuances and still retain part of their stories as part of your own.            "}

But what happens when a person finds a problem within themselves? When they\u2019ve finally gone through the agony of looking back at themselves and discover a problem, what do they do? I guess it would depend on the problem, and the person. For example, if someone were to figure out that they have a drug addiction then they might commit themselves to a rehab center, but if another person were to discover that they were compulsive liars, they might just continue on with their issues, possibly feeling guilty, but nonetheless continuing.   Reason I bring it up is because I have my own problems, and I full well acknowledge them, but I haven\u2019t changed every one of them. I used to have problems with abusing the internet for various reasons and I changed my ways, finally growing up and seeing that what I was doing was wrong and immoral. So in that instance I\u2019ve changed. But in others, with a lot of my other problems such as: not speaking up, holding back emotions, not watching my words (such as \u201cwhatever\u201d), and there are more I may touch on later.   With the first, not speaking up, I have a strange dilemma with, well, it may not be strange but it is a dilemma either way. So far, it has not put a huge dent on my life, there have been times where if I had spoken up I may have succeeded in something I otherwise took the back seat in, or it just plain would have been better had I said something, or said it louder. There was one situation where I could have missed out on the love of my life, but due to the incredible friends I have been so graciously gifted with, all was not lost and I get to share my heart with the most incredible person in the world, something I thought might not ever happen. But other than the prior mention issues, I have not had huge consequences on my inability to speak up, therefore I have not tried to change it. Lately though I have been coming to the grave realization that if this does not change I will not be able to move into adult life correctly. I can run a business, and have it be the most successful one in the world, I\u2019ve somewhat proven that in my journalism work, but the problem is getting there. In school, you can become acknowledged in basically one of two ways, through being loud about yourself, or by being recognized for diligence. My situation is the latter, I got where I am through what I have done, and it should work that way throughout the world, but unfortunately it does not. In the real world I have to network, talk to the right people, make the right connections, or else I\u2019m going no where. If I can\u2019t make contacts and just rely on my workmanship, I won\u2019t get where I want to be. Sure people would recognize me for being a workhorse, but I\u2019ll still be sitting at the bottom. Speaking up and voicing what I see and think along with my track record of good work is what will put me on top, I just have to learn to do it. I\u2019m trying desperately to grow up and overcome this issue, and only time will tell whether or not I am able to face the change.  With the second problem, holding back emotions, it\u2019s been more urgent to overcome, but I have pretty much done so. There is a \u2018but\u2019 though, I have only been able to do it because of the person I\u2019m in love with. I\u2019ve always felt like I was sensitive, but I haven\u2019t always shown it. Recently I have become more upfront about what it is I\u2019m feeling, in some ways anyway, I can honestly say that I whole heartedly try not to hold back what it is I\u2019m feeling when someone asks if there is something wrong with me. Sometimes though I still keep it to myself, maybe because it is for the better, or the situation isn\u2019t right for expelling emotions, or I\u2019m just being stoic. It\u2019s not always good for me to hold back though, because it hurts others that might want to help and creates a whole other problem worse than what you started out with. I\u2019m still unsure of what exactly I should do with this situation, but all I know is that I want to be more open and I\u2019m trying to do so every new day.  When it comes to watching my words, I need to do just that, watch them. Far too many times for my taste have I blurted out a \u2018whatever\u2019 when I completely did not mean to. I try to make use of an extensive vocabulary, but when I get tired it all just goes down hill. Especially when I\u2019m full up on emotions, I don\u2019t care what words I use, I just use them and only I know what I am saying, leaving the rest of the world out there hanging trying to figure out what it is I meant. And it usually turns out in ways I never meant it to. It\u2019s something I continue to work on, I\u2019m better than I used to be, but not perfect.  So being a human being myself, I would guess that everyone else goes through the same process. You see a problem, see where it has hurt you, or where it hasn\u2019t, and form that point you decide whether, subconsciously or otherwise, that you\u2019re going to either change or leave yourself be. It would be easier if we could all just treat ourselves like a system and get rid of whatever problem we have, but as humans it is more difficult because we complicate the issues; it\u2019s too hard for us to accept such sudden change. Point is we can change, it is in our nature, we just have to be able to acknowledge our problems and tackle them head on.   **By writing this I am in no way asserting that I know something you all do not, I am simply going through a thought process and putting it in writing so that I may be able to look back on it and gather new knowledge from seeing my thoughts laid out in print form. My reasoning for posting this is that it takes a bit of a deeper look at myself than my other writing normally does, so therefore it ends up on Logos & Amor rather than elsewhere.           "}
{"id": 463281, "author_id": 3492066, "gender": "female", "age": 34, "topic": "Student", "sign": "Cancer", "date": "03,July,2004", "text": "   I went over to what once was my grandparents\u2019 house today to help my mother pack things up for the big move on the 12th of this month, and was immediately given the odious chore of packing up the stuff on my grandfather\u2019s work-bench in the basement. Actually, it wasn\u2019t that bad, there was just a lot of stuff to pack. On the other hand, though, my mother told me that I could go through the boxes on the shelves against one of the walls and sort out what I wanted to keep.  This was a good thing.  This was a very good thing.  Apparently both my mother and my aunt haven\u2019t been entirely on top of things, then again my grandparents had a lot of things they\u2019ve gotten over the years to sort through, and being the inquisitive person that I am (i.e. a professional snoop/researcher since I was four) I made a number of finds they missed.  The first was a black faux fur coat that had been stuffed away. It looks like a cross between a wrinkled velvet blanket and a teddy-bear skin gone wrong but I liked it, must be my grandmother\u2019s side of me poking up.  Come to think of it, if I was leaning that way in my thoughts, I would have said that the spirits of my grandmother and grandfather were guiding me in a way, or at least bludgeoning me because I\u2019m the only one in the family who apparently pays attention in a half-assed sort of way.  You see, aside from the coat, I also found five boxes of L.P.s (yep, good old vinyl) of all kinds of music, although most were of a classical or operatic nature...which means they had to have been my grandmother\u2019s.  Add to that, I found three boxes of sheet music and old books on music, and I do mean old! There are more than a few that will need to be re-bound, and one of them had the date of 1909.  The above two things were important because music was very important to my grandmother. For most of her life she had been taking singing lessons and was very, very active in the music community here in St. Louis. Both an opera and a night club singer, she was one of the hands that built an opera company here in the city, as well as for a time had a night club called 'The Lorelei\u201d in Gaslight Square (a very ritzy, night-club area of town in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s).   To say she was a character would be like saying that a diamond was just shiny. She was a big woman, both in height and personality, a real grande dam. Among her possessions was a navy blue dress studded with a wide swath of rhine-stones around the collar and cuffs. I won\u2019t tell you how many shoes she had specifically because I\u2019ve never bothered to count, but she loved shoes, and being the only member of my family with big enough feet to fill them, what my aunt didn\u2019t take for her remembrance, I inherited, and there were a lot! And all in their own labeled shoe-boxes.  As for personality, I can sum up my grandmother into two small anecdotes. The first I learned of shortly before she died...that when she and my grandfather owned \u201cThe Lorelei\u201d not only did she sing, but her last song for the night would be \u201cLet Me Entertain You.\u201d This would have been no big thing except for the fact that as she was singing she would pull the falsies out of her dress and throw them into the audience. Note for those of you too young to know what \u201cfalsies\u201d are and those too old to remember...to sum up they were the old-timey version of the wonder-bra, only instead of it being a bra, it was just two pads that you stuck into your bra to lift, create cleavage, and make the breasts look a bit bigger.  The second of these small anecdotes: the morning my grandmother died from her long fight with metastasized melanoma, barely able to speak clearly because of the second tumor in her brain, she sang \u201cLet Me Entertain You\u201d with all the energy she could. Grasping the arms of the hospital bed we had put in her room at home (she had wanted to die in her home with my grandfather), she shook the bed while belting out the song as best she could and laughed when she was done. On the 5th of November 1999, shortly after 10 p.m. she passed away.  My aunt, the eldest of the two daughters my grandparents had, and the only two children they had, practically beatified my grandmother into sainthood when she passed, or so it seemed. Seeing it from my perspective, and with what I know, although my mother thinks my aunt is off of her rocker, I can understand where my aunt is coming from to some degree, and that it\u2019s part of her grieving process. Note: after my grandfather\u2019s death, my mother and my aunt finally came to terms with the blatant truth that while my aunt is the emotional one, my mother is the logical one...and both of them can take it to extremes.   What can I say, my aunt and my mother are human...and then I can laugh, because I know I\u2019m human too, and have my own quirks.  The big find of the day though came when I found a box marked \u201csouvenirs & letters.\u201d Opening it up, I found a hard-cover, leather bound notebook/binder with \u201cStudents Note Book\u201d embossed on the cover sitting on the top. The first lined page was dated 28 November 1934, and as that the rest of the notebook had all the hallmarks of a Roman Catholic school education, I assumed it to have once belonged to my grandmother, and as that she was born in 1923, that at the time of writing this, she would have been 11 years old.  If that had not been enough, right below it was a manila folder marked AG-201\u2014Klatz, Harold D. (Civ), and within the folder were letters my grandfather had written to her while he was serving in World War II, and interspersed with them are letters she had written him and other odds and ends from what looks to be May 1943 through September 1943. I still have to sort through them, and as I do, I\u2019m typing them into the computer with the full intents of making them available on the internet as well on the grounds that even if my computer goes belly-up, I will still have access to them. Not to mention, maybe someone else will find them interesting as well.  I have to admit that when I first found the letters and rifled through them, I came across a hand-written \u201cNotice of Divorce\u201d with another line right below it which read something like \u201cso we can get married again, and again, and again.\u201d Beneath the introductory phrase was a kind of running list of what my grandfather apparently liked about my grandmother, and I couldn\u2019t help but bust out laughing. One line read \u201cbuilt like a brick shithouse in a strong wind\u201d which is very much the way I view the youthful version of my grandfather\u2019s wild sense of humor. Not long after that I was in tears, sad because I miss both of my grandparents (my grandfather died in June of 2003), and sad because their house had been sold...a kind of physical reminder of their existence. I\u2019m still kind of grieving, which is fine, it\u2019s a part of life and I can contend with it...so long as I find something besides my shirt to blow my nose on.  Lloyd\u2019s comment upon seeing the box once we got it home was \u201cYou could be going through this for the rest of your life.\u201d We found neat clippings of news articles, camp newspapers, and comics in just the second bundle of letters wrapped in a \u201cVictory Pack.\u201d  Well, it\u2019s already getting late, so off to bed I go.   Needless to say, I\u2019ve had a couple of great inheritance\u2019s plopped into my proverbial lap. A real find for a history and archaeology junky like myself. :-)  "}

After the sleep in and slight grumpiness at missing out on seeing the kids this morning due to my own stupidity ... I realise now that I needed today. To stay indoors, even though it is gorgeously sunny outside and just listen to some good music (Sweetback is still in the player), do some reading and writing for uni.  Disclaimer: The below post ended up being dreary. It wasn't meant to be.  I was able to chat to my dearest friend who lives in Portugal. S moved to Portugal after highschool and is now completing a degree in Architecture. She is coming to Australia with her beau for Christmas so it will be nice to meet her and her man. We both return to Sydney a few days from each other in December - should be nice. The only thing is that S can be too intoxicating. Over our chat I was reminded of a argument we had when we were 14. S has always been demanding - for everything. Friendship, attention, listening, dancing, and gifts. It isn't an evil thing - just in equal amounts she is generous and caring. And I totally love her. But even today I was reminded of this fact when she tapped away in our chat ' I should take the time to remind you to bring me a gift from the States.' She was probably 1/2 joking, no a 1/4 joking, but the insinuation was still there and reminded me of the time she badgered me about a birthday present weeks and weeks before the actual event. I always felt compelled at the age of 13 - 18 to buy her expensive presents - I don't know why. Looking back she would have remained my friend either way. It baffles me to be honest. So this one time I actually started saving - which was hard as I didn't have an after school job, and I came from a single parent house hold with a parent who was paying for private education for two kids, paying a mortgage and still trying to provide the absolute best for her kids. But still I tried to save and with her birthday looming her badgering started to pick up, until a few days later I totally blew up. We were in class, Commerce Studies. She was asking me questions about what I had bought her. I still hadn't purchased anything. There was a silver ring I thought she'd like, but the store didn't have lay-by and I hadn't saved enough. So after a million questions and me avoiding the questions - I blew up and told her off. I think I even threatended to hit her - thats how mad I was. I was asked to leave the room ('That kind of behaviour is not tolerated in this school'). Damage was done. We didn't speak and I never had to buy the present for her because of that. I think it set the tone for how I deal with stress. I blow up and then allow the matter to deteriorate... which brings me the other issue on my mind today ...  My mother. I may have mentioned a few blogs back that there has been a silent conversation going on between my mother and I. Kind of difficult some might think seeing as we live in the same house. But with our schedules we hardly see each other ... except for today. We have both been home. She downstairs. Me upstairs in my room. This made me along with other 'signs' think about what has been going on between us. My attitude towards her has been one of avoidance from May. It an accumulative thing. Years of arguing, tension, tears, pain - we both share for a multitude of reasons, but tend to target each other as the cause of it. After last years self rebirth I came to the realisation that I probably shouldn't keep my mother as my target of said suffering. And for a while that worked. I focused on the task at hand(uni, work, health, exercise, friends, relationship), and when our communication became too much to bear for me (her criticism, nagging and guilt-ridden comments) I would retreat. But the same old same old has resurfaced. Blame my Scorpion sensibility of never letting things die, as I like to refer to determination and ALWAYS being the one in the right in May of this year I did not want to retreat casually as I had done so in the last year - I wanted to fight! Tell my mother why I am in pain. What she did and didn't do to help me. And try to drum into her that I am now an adult, capable of so much more than what she sees. She probably still sees a baby, or young thing. I am not quite sure how to change this. I worked full-time for two years before I went back fulltime to uni and started part-time work, and she was still the same. Angry and Critical. The emotional side of me goes for 'Why am I the victim in this' take. The logical side of me says its a clash of egos and an argument on two different playing field.  Today, I go with the latter - but on my down days I can help but feel like the victim. The daughter who was always there to listen to her mother's woes, to help with looking after a younger sister, being well behaved, doing well at school, getting into a good uni, working in respectable good companies and organisations, having good friends and a long stable relationship with a guy who respects my family and especially my mother, being responsible, diligent, respecting my elders - ALL THOSE THINGS! But when the claws are out I am attacked on a personal level for not being good enough. And then I blow up. And fall back down at being the victim.  So the question remains... What do I do? An Aunt gave me some advice late 2003 when my mother had another episode. She asked me if I had faith. She knows that I no longer go to church every Sunday, and that I question Christianity. I answered that I do have faith. I have faith that with great belief in humanity that we can have peace and love. She asked me to pray for myself for strength to love my mother as she is and not to ask for anymore. She said with that strength I will be able to show my mother what I am capable of. The faith was for me only - for my own strength. I ask my Dad who I know is my Guardian Angel to give me that strength ever day.  My Aunt also asked me to have faith in one hand and reality in the other. She said I had two options. One was to go my own way and not deal with my Mother and our problems. The other is to use my strength and face reality that because of so many issues, my mother sees me as her point of attack. After losing her husband, my father - and feeling let down by him she has had to carry on with life and raise two children on her own. I am used as her 'punching bag' sometimes. So the choice was walking away and limiting contact with her, or staying there with inner strength, having a relatively normal relationship and every so often deal with the crap. Back then I went for the inner strength advice. Today I am not so sure. I have come to realisation that I want the following:  to talk to my mother openly about everything - past, present, future not to be criticised share her struggles and listen to her stories be loved by my mother  Right now I need to work on that on my own. For now the silence is the easiest sound to hear.  LovePeaceRespectHumility     "}

If you do, they might break your heart...if you don't, you might break theirs.  Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person?  Your heart decides whom it likes and whom it doesn't. ou can't tell your heart what to do. It does it on its own........when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.  Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?  Too many of us stay walled up because we are too afraid to care too much...for fear that the other person does not care as much, or even at all.  Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?  We tell lies when we are afraid... afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us.

If it comes back, it's yours. If it doesn't... Catch it, tie it up and play boy band songs to it until is has no more willpower of self confidence left.'   I'm too lazy to change my quote right now. It's two in the morning and I haven't slept in about thirty-nine or so hours now. Hmm... I don't want to sleep. Right now, I'm so afraid that all of this is one big dream and I'm going to wake up and go back to that harsh existence I call reality. This euphoria is much more preferable.  I suppose, as usual, I should explain myself. Well, I'll tell the tale of the past two days. Yah... It's really two, and I'm really tired, but I want to write this all down, perhaps to prove it all genuine.  I spent the fourth of July with a friend of mine. It was a fun movie filled event, three of which I had seen, but I saw  The Girl with a Pearl Earring.  It was beautiful. It really was. I need to read the book before my sister hits me upside the head with it though. She can be really evil sometimes. Anyway, no great fireworks to report. I think they're getting skimpy. Though I did see a rogue firework. Bad news in this drought. I hope it didn't burn anything down. I stayed up til ten in the morning.   We ran to Walgreen at two and got soda and believe it or not condoms. She got them, the were her choice after all, but I managed to get one and it's in my drawer. I thought it was amusing. It was basically a girl's all out fun fest. My friend and I talked and I told her things that I never told some of my other friends, and I felt better for saying it.  After I went home, it would have been logical to sleep. I had a friend coming after all, and I looked a bloody mess. Logic, is not my strong point. Probably why I suck at math so badly. Therefore. I went into my mom's room and noticed I had a package for men from Hong Kong. I spent several minutes staring at it. Who the hell did I know from Hong Kong? I called my mom about it just as it occurred to me. I know who sent this to me. Turns out it was a Pucca and Garu doll from the guy I've been arguing with. It was scarce minutes after that when I got his phone call.  I specifically told him not to call.  As though I'm listened to anyway. Do no call seem to mean, except when I'm depressed... A twenty-four seven condition. He was having issues here, and, for his privacy, I won't get into them. Besides. It's a small bad part of a good day. Plain and simple.  The guy I was waiting to call was an hour late in calling. He had slept in... Lucky... After like an hour of getting things together, we actually managed to get him here. It was a miracle. I saw him for a scant amount of time once a year ago, and I otherwise had had no contact with him. I was so happy. Happier than I had been in a while. Especially after week of hell.  I'm still struck, even now by how tall he is. He used to be shorter than me, back in like middle school, but he's at least a head taller than me now, something he rubbed in a few times. His voice had also changed, deeper and something I was unaccustomed to, but I liked it anyway. It suited him.   We talked for a few hours in my room after that. A lot of it catching up, a lot of it joke telling. I had forgotten how much he used to make me laugh. He's also gotten a lot of stronger than me, not that it's difficult. I'm not at all known for muscle, but it was fun trying to pretend I did. It reminded me of old times. He was, after all, one of the best things about middle school.  Neh, he's gonna be reading this... Fuck, I hate this ego thing...  Ok, then we went out to the living room and we ended up watching a reality show my family's fond of, and we started cuddling on the couch. At first, I thought little of it. Not the first time, not the last. Then his fingers started stroking my upper arm. His other hand was touching min, running up and down my other arm. I lost all interest in the show then. I watched his fingers trail over my skin with fascinated eyes. I didn't dare mention it. I was so afraid of breaking the moment. Afraid he'd realize what he was doing and stop. So I happily played along with the game, my fingers playing with his as I buried my head in his shoulder.  I'm telling it like an author... It's nearly three now, so... neh...  This continued for sometime, and I sat there, completely petrified of ruining it. The damn Fae who run my blog know I haven't had a boyfriend in ages. Forgot what it was like. I relearned very quickly when we started kissing.  I was positive that the line between dream and reality had faded into nothing, or that I had fallen asleep and I was dreaming the feel of lips on mine. I even told him so, and he assured me of the reality... As though there's anyway to assure half dead psycho of reality. I'm still not sure it's all real. Not sure if it even happened. Not sure if all the wonderful things that happened afterward were all dreams.  There's only one thing that I'm sure was real. That was the water. We walked down to a pool. I say 'a' pool because my complex has about six. He got us both wet while we were wading in the water, and I dream about water so often that the reality of the water struck me. I could feel water. It was cold and it was wet, and this was real.   It's a completely amazing though, and I know that this euphoria won't last, but for now I want to enjoy it.  I want to hope I see him again.  Faylinn out.         "}

Blog entries are so much more rewarding.        These last two weeks have been very challenging.  So many things to contend with.  I am finding that I just don't have the emotional strength to carry all my old baggage with the new.  So I've decided to dump it all and get me a matching set of Louis Vuitton.  First, the dumping:   To All Who Have Broke My Heart, Hurt my feelings or Made me Mad,  Hey guys, what's up?  Sorry to send you this in a cheezy blog entry, but there are a good handful of you that getting in touch with personally would be very difficult.  So I figured I'd just drop you all a note and let you know that I have given this a lot of thought and I really think that you all suck.  Seriously.   Remember the time I got kicked out of that gay kid club thingy for like a week?  Yeah, that wasn't fun.  I remember looking to so many of you for support and never getting it.  Now, I realize that I'm just me, and there were a lot of people involved up in that shindig, but I felt that I was always there for you.  I looked out for you.  I protected you.  I helped so many of you to be proud of who you are.  Do you think it was easy being the only gay face in front of the entire compliment of unsupportive university students and staff requesting equal treatment?  How many fights did I fight in your name?  How much dirt did I get in my face for it?  And Where were you when I needed you to fight for me?  Not there, and that's bullshit guys.  For real.  But that was a long time ago, I guess I should be kinda over it. Huh?  Now I know I have dealt with this same issue with you particularly over and over and over again.  It's crap and everyone is tired of me talking about it.  But when I think back to who really fucked me over, took advantage of me, made me feel cheap, used, worthless, inhuman and uncared for, you still kinda win.  We were both young, stupid, blah blah blah, whatever, I know.  Yet, I really feel I was a good friend to you and didn't deserve the treatment I received in return.  I hope you know that I truly wanted the best for you and did my best to help you get what you wanted out of life at great compromise to what I wanted from mine.  I was supportive of you, wasn't I?  I tried to be.  And I know it must have been difficult for you because I asked a lot of you, like cleaning up after yourself in my studio apartment that I let you stay in all summer rent free, not lie to me, not stand me up when I came to visit you and as base as it is, return the favor and suck my dick too.  I know, I'm a bastard for expecting all this of you, but ultimately I feel I was a true friend to you.  You were not.  And you've never really owned up to it.  You've never really apologized for it, and I know you never will.  Regardless of how much time has past or how much I just don't give a fuck anymore, that will always, well -- hurt, just a little.  You jerk.  John, I know it's terrible and wrong but I am so mad at you right now.  You borrowed my stew pot and never gave it back.  You borrowed my allen keys and never gave them back either!  I couldn't get my bed apart.  When I moved last week I had to bend and contort all the pieces because without those keys, I couldn't get them apart and it was a terrible disaster.  I have felt for years like I have done you wrong John.  I have had awful horrid guilt for letting you move to Virginia with that dude when I knew it wasn't right.  I knew it wasn't going to make you happy.  I let you go and I never said good bye and then you died, taking my allen keys with you and eventually totally screwing up my bed!    Rufie, I am not mad at you at all, but you broke my heart something fierce.  It's my fault too.  I know it is.  It's just that you would always get lethargic and I'd take you to the vet, spend $200 and they'd tell me you were fine.  I didn't want to spend the money again.  Why didn't you just tell me that time was different Rufie?  But you did though didn't you?  I don't think I was listening. I am so sorry.  I'd give up everything I have to get you back.  I really would.  I miss you so bad.   Speaking of not true friends, you, mofo, take the f-word cake.  Now I am know I am not always the easiest of people to get along with.  I'm crass.  I'm brazen.  I'm 'outspoken' to say the least.  However, I can't help but feel I have always been there for you.  I was one of two people who showed up to help you move.  I brought you vapor rub and crackers when you were sick.  I answered the phone when you called me crying your face off at 5:30 in the am.  I've lent you my drill numerous times, for weeks at a time, that if I needed back I had to go and physically retrieve myself!  And where were you when I needed you?  Not there, and for what?  Some childish grudge that I have absolutely no idea where it came from!  Oh, and then you went and tattled on me at work and ran away.  That was cute.  I bet you get a sense of pleasure knowing that you have totally fucked up my work environment, and that I have been removed from the bar schedule because of it.  That is the kind of person you are.  Well, whatever, I'm okay with it.  I have to deal with the consequences of my actions.  I just take solace in knowing that I am, and always will be a better person than you, and that nobody likes you.  Speaking of work, Boss, you really let me down this time.  Five years and not one word.  My entire early and mid twenties of blood, sweat, tears and minimum wage and not so much as a pat on the back.  That's all I wanted.  I don't think that's too much to ask.  Yet, it is my own fault.  I have been there for a long time and you have never recognized the loyalty or dedication of any of your long time withstanding staff.  I was foolish to think I would be any different.  But I still don't think that's cool.      So I gotta let you guys go now.  You're bringing me down dudes.  Now I know I have said this before with  a lot of you but I really think I mean it this time.  For sure.  I feel I deserve better than what you offer.  Except for you Rufort.  Daddy will always love you. I will keep you close to my heart with fond memories, a tear and a smile.                  "}

I haven't been doing that much lately...I wonder how I've changed as a person this last year. I think back to the beginning of the year and I can't help wondering if I've grown as a better person than I started this year as. I hate to turn this post into some kind of God commercial, but when you care about something so passionatly and with so much energy, it can't be helped when it overflows into all aspects of life. I don't know what it is...I guess C.S. Lewis puts it into a perspective that I can describe it as in his 'Mere Christianity.'                 'If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is                  that I was made for another world.'   This world is so empty. There doesn't seem to be an kind real purpose or reason to exist in this mundane way. School, homework, school, homework. I guess I can fill it with worldy and small 'happy' moments where life seems to be perfect for that one awesome night, but why? Why should I waste time, money, and energy in seeking after something so...Meaningless? So I can feel good? Ha. Isn't that what life is all about? Society seems to be feeding us this concept of 'whatever feels good is good for you' but in reality, that can't be further from the truth. Our flesh and minds are constantly seeking after the things that tend to destroy us. We can glorify the things that this society has come to value so much but reality will always be true no matter how sugar-coated they are. Unfortunately, everyone fails. No one is perfect. No one can live a life completely free from immoral actions. Why are we made like this? Why must we be CREATED to FAIL? I think the answer lies in the creator: God. God. Why is that such a taboo word? How has God become such a heatedly debated topic? Why are supposed intellectuals so keen on denouncing the existence of God? Can it be that their own immoral desires make it convenient NOT to believe in an all-mighty law giver? While this is a possibility for many, others can see him as unfair. Why would he de unfair to ME? Why would he do WRONG to me? WHY ME? THAT'S why He doesn't exist. There CANNOT be a JUST and KIND God that allows such gratuitous evil here on earth. Hold on. Let's examine that for a second. Other than that being quite a selfish reason, let's check on the logic behind that. THere cannot be a God that allows such evil? OK, so, if you believe in the concept of evil, than, you must also believe that there is good. SO, you must also believe that there is a universal moral law. Then, there MUST also be a universal moral law GIVER. It couldn't sprung out of nowhere and no mere human ancestor could have just developed it as a tool for survival, morality goes against the selfish desires of man. They are a sacrifice on the individual for order. So if it isn't from some random step, than what, or rather WHO is it from? This is where an individuals judgement comes in. There is absolutely no concrete proof that GOD exists. AND, there is absolutely no proof that GOD does NOT exist. SO, one can come to their own conclusion. I happened to have concluded that a supreme being created and implanted the concept of morality into each and every human being. There are certain wrongs and certain goods that we are all born to understand. A wrong for example, rape and murder, and a good being love. Of course, people can have their judgment on what they prefer, but I believe that deep down everyone knows between good and evil. The fact that this person can ask why God can let the possibility of evil to exist points to the fact that there is such a thing as moral law. He might also ask how God could let someone die and kill someone who lived a good life. Saying this about God doesn't make sense because if God is the creator of life and he gave that life to that person, who is to say that the creator is even taking the life when he also has the power to restore it to the very purpose of it which is to enjoy that relationship w/ him and to glorify him. God's answer to our pain and the evil in this world is His gift to us, a sign of his mercy, his son Jesus Christ who died in place of us so that we may have life.  ------  Also, why do we believe that God's purpose is human happiness? that's so stupid. We put him into this little box where if he doesn't do what WE think he should do, than he doesn't exist. We only believe what conveniences us. And who are we to say that some suffering is gratuitous? If you look at the countries with the greatest amount of suffering, it is almost a 1:1 correlation of the rapid growth in the Christian church. And on the flipside, wherever there is material wealth and comfort, the growth is nonexistent, or even declining. We need to keep in mind that God's purposes in life are much broader than what is conducive to our happiness. His ultimate purposes are to establish the Kingdom of God. Furthermore, anyone's suffering must be seen in light of the cross. God isn't just some high and holy being that does whatever he does. He actually suffered on the cross for us, to show us the extent of his abounding love. Then, the problem comes into an entirely different perspective. Now the problem is not how God can justify himself before us, it is how WE who sin and who are morally corrupt can justify ourselves before HIM. Then, we can see the cross and ask, if God can suffer that much and bear that incredible burden of the WORLD'S sin, than surely I can endure this brief bit of suffering on earth that He has asked me to endure for HIm.         ++++-----------------------------++++    Society has come to a point where information is almost completely hand fed to us. Whatever we see on television or hear on the radio must be true. Our generation has become one so dependent on the thinking of others that we are no longer able to think for ourselves. In an age of inundation of information, how are we to take all this in and process it to apply to our own lives? All we do is take it at face value and accept it as truth. Now, granted this is quite a generalization and there are many incredible minds out there, but as a whole, society seems to have fallen into quite a rut. How are we to climb out of this grave we have dug for ourselves? What are we to make of the demoralization of the world? I think the answer once again lies in the Creator.     \\\\\\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~///    On a completely different note, here's something I found and kept earlier in life. I never knew the extent to which it would ring true....     It's Raining in Love   -by Richard Brautigan  I don't know what it is, but I distrust myself when I start to like a girl      a lot.  It makes me nervous. I don't say the right things or perhaps I start        to examine,                        evaluate                                    compute        what I am saying.  If I say, Do you think it's going to rain?' and she says, 'I don't know,' I start thinking: Does she really like me?  In other words I get a little creepy.  A friend of mine once said, 'It's twenty times better to be friends      with someone than it is to be in love with them'  I think he's right and besides, it's raining somewhere, programming flowers and keeping snails happy.       That's all taken care of.                      BUT if a girl likes me a lot and starts getting real nervous and suddenly begins asking me funny questions and looks sad if I give the wrong answers and she says things like, 'Do you think it's going to rain?' and I say, 'It beats me,' and she says, 'Oh,' and looks a little sad at the clear blue California sky, I think: Thank God, it's you, baby, this time     instead of me.

The \u201cDemon Star\u201d as it is sometimes known. A star found in the westernmost region of the giraffe-shaped constellation \u201cPerseus\u201d.  In 1670, when it was discovered that the visual magnitude of the star changed constantly over a period of 69 hours, it was said that this was due to a partial eclipse caused by another body in space. This was later confirmed in 1889.  Recently, scientists came up with a new theory. They now believe that there may be something sinister about the ever-constant flashing, for it was recently discovered that the cycle was occurring over a period of 20 minutes and with each cycle, the time was dropping by a fraction of a second. It was said that at this rate, the flashing would come to a complete stop in approximately 6 years 3 months and 27 days. In other words, today\u2026in about 3 minutes, or so I\u2019ve calculated. My name is Damien Thorpe. Although I work for the NASA Ames Research Centre in California, I\u2019m currently stationed here at the University of California in Berkeley. My job, to find out what happens when the flashing stops. Not long to go now.  Little was I to know that they didn\u2019t need me to tell them what was about to happen. The whole planet would soon find out for themselves. One minute to go. The cycle is now occurring over a meagre 0,02 seconds. The hair on the back of my neck is tingling.  Right now, I have the eyes of every influential person on the planet, trained on me, waiting for my hypothesis. Actually, it\u2019s more than a hypothesis they want. They want the exact facts. I\u2019m not in any position to give it to them though.  Thirty seconds to go. My ears start ringing. I think of my family. My beautiful wife Kelsey. My six year old daughter Jade and my two year old son Orin. What I wouldn\u2019t do to be with them now. Twenty seconds left. I\u2019ve got a bad feeling about this. Don\u2019t exactly know why. This star is more than 300 billion miles away. That\u2019s about 200 light years. Ten more seconds. My palms start perspiring. My vision becomes fuzzy. I can\u2019t think straight anymore. Five seconds. \u201cOh God!\u201d Four seconds. \u201cPlease help us!\u201d Three seconds. \u201cKelsey!\u201d Two seconds. \u201cJade!\u201d One second. \u201cOrin\u201d Time\u2019s up. The next few milliseconds seem to last forever. I remember my whole life. I remember playing in the park across from our house as a child. I remember my first day of Senior High. My freshman year at Yale University. Graduation day when I was chosen as scholar of the decade. My first day on the job. My wedding day. Oh how beautiful Kelsey was in that dress. The day Jade came into our lives.  The day we were blessed with Orin. Saying goodbye to them when I left this morning for work. Then, the minute just past runs itself over and over in my head. It passes.  Time\u2019s up\u2026. I\u2019ve come to my senses. Time\u2019s up\u2026. I remember. Time\u2019s up\u2026.  The sky lights up with a brilliant white light. For a moment \u2013 just a moment \u2013 it almost seems beautiful. Then, as suddenly as it came, it disappears, taking with it all other sources of light.  The earth is plunged into darkness. Looking up, it\u2019s almost as if the sun wasn\u2019t even there. And it needn\u2019t have been anyway, because overhead, a huge atmospheric phenomenon is occurring. A bank of clouds, one as such I\u2019ve never seen before, begins to cover the sky. Unknown to me at the time, the same was occurring, not just here, but all over the globe skies were being covered by this ominous black cloud. The darkness had come. It\u2019s been just under two years since that terrifying day. Electricity is non existent. It\u2019s like being back in the dark ages. People use home made candles as a source of light. They try to keep it to a minimum though, so as not to attract too much attention. Nowadays attention is the last thing you want to attract.  Since the darkness came, a whole new breed of animal has risen. The Screeches. Named so because of the spine-chilling shriek they emit. Like bats they use this shriek to gain a sense of direction as well as \u201csee\u201d their prey. Unlike bats though, this shriek can be heard by the human ear. It is a terrifying sound.  Humans have come to live in fear of these creatures, as they quickly finished all natural animal resources. It is now just our species left for them to eat.  Due to the lack of natural resources, we have also come to live in fear of ourselves. Humans will kill and eat another human if the hunger is great enough. We do not roam the dark streets for fear of other humans, but most of all, we do not roam the dark streets for fear of the Screeches.   Screeches. Large black animals with a hard leathery skin and a mouth with multiple rows of teeth.  They first came about a year ago (I do not know exactly how long ago, as we don\u2019t bother to keep track of dates and times anymore). Since mankind\u2019s first encounter with these creatures, we\u2019ve only managed to kill seven. Seven! In comparison to the hundreds of thousands that they\u2019ve killed. Unlike other animals from earlier years, these appear to be adapting very rapidly. They started out as animals roughly the same size and shape as lions. We managed to kill four of them, but when we discovered that we were fighting a losing battle, we decided to move to higher ground, where they could not get to us. Then came the winged ones. Same size, same shape, but with wings. They quickly found our hiding place in the mountains and hills. We killed one of these. Unfortunately, they were too agile and swift for us to properly defend ourselves, so we moved again. This time, we started using the oceans as a hiding place, building forts deep under the ocean waters. It wasn\u2019t long after that we found they had adapted again. This time, they came to us in the shape of sharks. When the people first started dying, we assumed it was a species of shark that was attacking us, until we managed to kill one.   Studies of the body lead us to the conclusion that they were the same creature, but in a different form. We have since killed another one.  We considered moving back up to land level, seeing as how these creatures had adapted themselves to the water. We figured that it would buy us some time.  We sent out numerous parties to scour the land above, but the few people that managed to return safely told us that these creatures had not adapted completely. Their other counterparts stilled roamed the earth above. Driven by the will to survive, we have now built entire cities under the waves.  Cities covered by many layers of steel, to keep the creatures out. So far it\u2019s working, but research has shown that these creatures are getting bigger and bigger and soon, these steel walls are not going to be enough to keep them out.  We have since started building rockets. Our next habitat will be in the vacuum of space. Scientists estimate that it will be at least another year before we are ready to move again. They also estimate that it will only take a few months before these creatures find their way into the cities \u2013 maybe even less.  One would think that, in times such as these, mankind would come together and unite their efforts for the sake of saving our race. The opposite is true though, as we seem to have turned against each other. There is no sense of community anymore. Humans simply live together due to a lack of space, not choice.  When I talk about humans eating one another, I talk from personal experience. About six months ago Kelsey left me. She came home one day and found me hunched over our bed, blood completely covering the bedspread. I had torn Orin limb from limb and was in the process of eating him when she walked in.  The strange thing is, I don\u2019t regret it at all, not a single moment. It tasted so sweet and tender. So sweet that since that day, I\u2019ve eaten a number of others. I have tried to find her and Jade since then. Not to ask for forgiveness. Not to ask them to love me again.  I want to find them, so that I can eat them too, just like Orin. Eating all those other people has never been the same as the day I ate Orin. I\u2019ve come to believe that the meat of a family member is sweeter than the meat of a stranger. I\u2019ll find out when I catch them. Right now, I\u2019m on my way across town. I\u2019m heading to a reservoir on the other side of the city.  I\u2019ve received word that Kelsey might be there. Oh I hope so. The hunger is killing me. I stop for a pack of cigarettes at the local supermarket. Cigarettes are now handmade using strips of cloth rolled over shavings of seaweed.   I step out of the store and stop to light the cigarette. A flash in the corner of my eye catches my attention. I turn to see what it is. Nothing. The alley on the side of the supermarket seems deserted. I decide to check it out anyway. Maybe it\u2019s a homeless drunk. If I eat him, no one should miss him. I enter the alley and immediately recognise the odour emanating from within. At first, I can\u2019t remember where I\u2019d smelt it before. Then it hits me. A Screech. But that\u2019s impossible. There\u2019s no way one of them could have got inside the city walls.   I consider turning and running but decide against it when I think of the amount of meat I can salvage from it if I can kill it. I take out my pocket-knife. Hardly big enough to kill a cat, but it\u2019s all I have. I move further into the alley with my knife held out in front of me life a priest holding a cross.  It happens so suddenly. Out of nowhere it jumps at me, shrieking like a banshee. It tears off my arm with one swipe of its claws. I don\u2019t feel a thing. It\u2019s as if it\u2019s not really happening to me. Almost as if I were watching it all from across the street.  The first thing I notice is that it\u2019s standing on two legs. A new adaptation. Smart! Never saw it coming. At that time I realise that mankind is not going to survive this next attack. I get the feeling that this is not a lone Screech. This is just the only one that I know of. I\u2019m pretty sure that this exact thing is happening all over the city.  I look at my hand and for the first time, I realise that not only is my arm gone, a large portion of my shoulder is gone too. Ripped completely off. Torn apart like a piece of paper. I can\u2019t help but think about what I\u2019m going to miss. I think about the fact that I will never see the outside of this alley again. Never light up another cigarette or smell the pungently sweet smell of the rubbish dump across the street from my apartment. I think about the fact that I\u2019ll never get to go into outer space to our next habitat. That doesn\u2019t bother me too much though, because I know that nobody else will either. I also notice that I don\u2019t think about the past at all. I don\u2019t think about playing in the park, graduating from Yale, my wedding day or the birth of my children. Things have changed since that first day of the New World. My mind has changed. It has become warped.  The only thing that I cannot help but wonder is whether or not the taste of Kelsey and Jade will be sweeter to these animals than any of the other humans around. I can\u2019t help but feel sad that these creatures will eat them.  Not sad because I don\u2019t want them to die. Sad because it should have been my opportunity.   None of that matters anymore though.  With the next swipe, the creature tears the flesh from my face. I live long enough to get one last thought. I can\u2019t decide which thought should be my last, but I don\u2019t have time to choose, so I take the first one that comes to mind.  Kelsey and Jade. So sweet. So sweet.    *It makes one wonder \u2013 \u201cWho are the real monsters?\u201d*          "}

Me : 13   Me : well, 7, if you don't count the dead ones  &nbsp;  See? I can be funny. Sadistic, yes, but funny.  &nbsp;  Dude, The Shins have broken through. That opening 'Woo!' on 'Kissing the Lipless,' was played on the Johnny Depp 'A2Z.' Obviously, I know that everyone who viewed that program immediately rushed over to the internet to find out who screamed that godly 'Woo!' You know it.  &nbsp;  Did anyone else crack up when that black guy on '99 said it took him four or five times to understand  The Sixth Sense ? Mmmm. I could live forever off of that stuff.  &nbsp;  I watched  The Big Lebowski  today. For the first time. I know, I know, it's horrible. Not the movie, the fact that it was released in 1998 and right now it is 2004. Goddamn, that is my kind of movie. Just a long, nonsensical, and lazy&nbsp;yet complex&nbsp;plot and John Goodman rambling about his experiences in 'Nam. So so funny and unique. And I almost cried. Seriously, after they dumped out the ashes and Dude yells at Walter for all the 'Nam references and Walter just hugs him... damn. I want to make a movie like that. I just want to make movies.  &nbsp;  What happened to that dream? My dream of being like Brendon Small and making a bunch of movies? I'll tell you what, it died, because I lost interest. I mean, I still really want to do it, I'm just not creative enough right now to write anything. I had that one script, and I think it was funny, but I lost interest and didn't find it funny after playing around with it so much. For the longest time, I've just wanted to direct a movie to see what it feels like. I think I could do a good job at it. Hmm.  &nbsp;  But like I said in a conversation with Kit, 'I don't have the persistance to make anything bigger than a sandwich.'  &nbsp;  Oh shit! Speaking of 'Home Movies,' Soup2Nuts is releasing a three disc DVD set of 'Home Movies' on November 13th. This is very, very good news.  &nbsp;  What the hell? They played part of the chorus of Denis Leary's 'Asshole,' song during '99, except they bleeped out the word Asshole. So all you hear is  BLEEP oo-ee-ooo-ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oole! So stupid. Why put it in there if they're just going to bleep it? VH1 needs to lower their bleep usage. Like during the South Park part, when Chef said ' BLEEP  on my Chocolate Salty Balls. Put 'em in your mouth and  BLEEP  'em.' You guys, God, the song is about a tasty salty chocolate snack. He is talking about eating his wonderous product that he slaved over in order to make some money. It is not some lude reference to oral sex. Christ. Get your minds out of the gutters.  &nbsp;  Haha, I said that the black guy  slaved  over his food. Get it? Because we used to whip black people and make them do our chores without pay or food stamps.  &nbsp;  I'm gonna be talking about 'I Love the 90's,' a lot for the next couple weeks, because it will be all I will be watching. Reruns have never been so tasty good.  &nbsp;  I recieved a junk e-mail from someone that called themselves Shovelful B. Ferreted.  &nbsp;  I found part of my script thingy. Opinions?:   (A man holding an ancient-looking statue runs down a road, being distantly pursued by nine security guards. The guards lose track of the man when they come to a fork in the road, so they stop to figure out which way he went)  Head Guard: Which way did he go?  Guard 1: I think he went that way! (points to left road)  Guard 2: No, no, no, I saw him go that way. (points to right road)  Head Guard: Okay, we'll split up. Half of you go that way (points right) and the rest of you come with me.  Guard 3: Hey, wait a minute!  Head Guard: What?  Guard 3: Well, it's just that.. there's nine of us. We can't exactly split in half.  Guard 4: Yeah! If you divide nine in two parts, you get four and a half! And we don't have a half-person with us!  Guard 5: We could make one. And if we're going to chop somebody in half, I propose that it be Johnson.  (Everybody but Head Guard and Guard 2 nod and mutter in agreement)  Guard 2: Shut it Langston!  Head Guard: Look, we're not cutting anybody in half! You four go that way, and the other four of you come with me! Now let's go! He's getting away!  Guard 4: Wait, that's not fair at all. We can't divide into uneven groups. What if he isn't working alone and we get outnumbered!  (Others mutters in agreement again)  Head Guard: Then what do you suggest we do?  Guard 3: Well, since there's nine of us, why don't we split into three groups of three?  Guard 1: But where would the third group go?  (A couple seconds of silence pass by)  Guard 2: Umm... How about they go back to the house?  Head Guard: Back to the house? But then there wouldn't be enough people out looking for the thief! Come on people! We need everyone out here looking for the statue! Now let's go!  Guard 5: How about I just go back to the house and you guys go look for the statue?  Head Guard: (Hesitates while contemplating the query) ...Alright, you head back to the house. You four! That way! You three! With me!  Guard 1: Why does he get to go back! It's cold out here and I have to go to the bathroom! I should get to go!  (Other guards chime in with their own reasons why they should go back to the house)  Head Guard: Everybody shut up!  (Guards all stop talking, except Johnson, who decides to finish his story when the others are all quiet)  Guard 2: ...and I left my hemorrhoid cream back there.  (Everyone backs away and looks at Johnson with glares of disgust)  Head Guard: Johnson... Christ, that's gross.  Guard 2: (pause) They.. they aren't contagious.  (Long pause)  Head Guard: People! We are getting off topic here! That man stole the statue, and if we don't get it back, Klein is going to fire us! Is that what you want?  Guard 4: You know, he's right. We really should be out looking for that guy.  (Other guards all cough-talk phrases like, 'Bullshit' and 'Suck up')  Guard 4: No! I'm being serious! How about we just have some kind of tournament to determine who gets to go back to the house?  Guard 1: Yeah! We could all play rock-paper-scissors!  Guard 3: No, we should have a basketball tournament!  Guard 5: You guys are so lame. A Magic tourney is the only sure-fire way to decide.  (Other guards simultaniously make their own suggestions)  Head Guard: You guys, come on!  Guard 1: Yeah, we all have our own ideas, so arguing is pointless. We need to think of a way to determine who's idea for a contest we should use to determine the tournament that will determine who gets to go back to the house.  Head Guard: If we don't leave in the next 30 seconds, you're all going back to the house in body bags.  Guard 3: Bags? Hey! How about we have a potato sack race?!  Guard 1: That's perfect! Jonas, you brought your bags with you, right?  Guard 4: Psh. When don't I? (pulls nine bags out from behind his back)  (Guard 4 walks around and hands out the bags to each guard. They all get in a line and prepare to start the race, except for the Head Guard.)  Head Guard: STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT!  (Guards all quiet and stare at Head Guard with confused looks)  (Head Guard pulls out his pistol and shoots Guard 5, killing him; When Guard 5 falls to the ground, Guard 4 goes down by his side)  Guard 4: No! You shot Terry! (starts sobbing) You shot Terry!  Head Guard: (While Guard 4 is still complaining) All right! Now there's only eight of us! Now can we please! Go and get the statue back!  Guard 4: (Looks up at the sky) Don't worry Terry! I'm coming with you!  (Guard 4 pulls out his pistol and shoots himself in the head and slumps over Guard 5's body)  Head Guard: Oh, fuck this.  (Head Guard slumps away in the direction of the house, slowly followed by all the other guards)  Guard 3: (to Guard 1 as they are walking toward the house) I told you they were gay.  (Then star-wipe, and.... cut)  &nbsp;  I know, it's short. But at least I wrote something.  &nbsp;  Kit should really start trying to write her Tech Deck mockumentary. Then we can bring it to life in film.           "}
