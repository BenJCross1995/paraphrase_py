(Head Guard slumps away in the direction of the house, slowly followed by all the other guards)  Guard 3: (to Guard 1 as they are walking toward the house) I told you they were gay. (Then star-wipe, and.... cut)  &nbsp;  I know, its short. But at least I wrote something. &nbsp;  Kit should really start trying to write her Tech Deck mockumentary. Then we can bring it to life in film."}

My trip to Egypt has solidified my belief that first and foremost, I am a filmmaker. I dont think there is anything that I enjoy as much as the filmmaking process. Although the Egypt production was pretty low budget, I could totally see myself doing a combination of ethnographic/social documentaries as well as fictional narrative films. I think that one part could finance the other. Now I just need to find a way to finance film projects on a continuous basis. Going the academic route is certainly one possibility. There is something to be said about being in school for 9 months and then applying for a grant to shoot for another three months. I would just need to find an academic program that would allow me to combine the two. Im not much of a cultural anthropology guy, but if thats what it takes, I may go that route. The other route would be to concentrate on one comparative area (say the Middle East or Latin America) and enroll in an academic program that focuses on a variety of socio-political and economic issues from the said area, and then apply for grants to shoot films in that area. I suppose that another academic route would be to go for the MBA, specialize in entrepreneurship, and use that academic foundation to open up a production company that combines the academic documentaries along with narrative fictional projects. Thats the strongest possibility right now."}

So being a human being myself, I would guess that everyone else goes through the same process. You see a problem, see where it has hurt you, or where it hasn\u2019t, and form that point you decide whether, subconsciously or otherwise, that you\u2019re going to either change or leave yourself be. It would be easier if we could all just treat ourselves like a system and get rid of whatever problem we have, but as humans it is more difficult because we complicate the issues; it\u2019s too hard for us to accept such sudden change. Point is we can change, it is in our nature, we just have to be able to acknowledge our problems and tackle them head on. **By writing this I am in no way asserting that I know something you all do not, I am simply going through a thought process and putting it in writing so that I may be able to look back on it and gather new knowledge from seeing my thoughts laid out in print form. My reasoning for posting this is that it takes a bit of a deeper look at myself than my other writing normally does, so therefore it ends up on Logos & Amor rather than elsewhere."}

Some childish grudge that I have absolutely no idea where it came from! Oh, and then you went and tattled on me at work and ran away. That was cute. I bet you get a sense of pleasure knowing that you have totally fucked up my work environment, and that I have been removed from the bar schedule because of it. That is the kind of person you are. Well, whatever, Im okay with it. I have to deal with the consequences of my actions. I just take solace in knowing that I am, and always will be a better person than you, and that nobody likes you. Speaking of work, Boss, you really let me down this time. Five years and not one word. My entire early and mid twenties of blood, sweat, tears and minimum wage and not so much as a pat on the back. Thats all I wanted."}
