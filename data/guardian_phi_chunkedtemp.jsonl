What, then, did she make of Charless ambitious mistress? The woman features here only once, on page 795, identified as the wife of a royal guest, Andrew Parker Bowles: theirs is a joint entry in a 1970s Castle of Mey visitors book. The author devotes far more space to the Queen Mothers lunches, to the decorations on her millions of hats, to her horses, to the various inert objects he spots then solemnly itemises, as if in training for the world championships of the tray game. Among the ornaments arranged on a Castle of Mey desk, he doggedly reports, is a little corgi from the Buckingham Palace gift shop. It sits there now. The Queen Mothers house, Shawcross assures us, is preserved as it was in her lifetime. He has chosen to do the same thing for her reputation. If its hard to respect a biographer capable of an omission on the Camilla scale, it is impossible to trust him. What else has he left out? Shawcross records Princess Margarets vandal decision to destroy letters from Diana to the Queen Mother because, she said, they were so private. Given his determination to empathise, at all times, with the royal point of view, his comment on this affair may be read as savagely critical: It was understandable, although regrettable from a historical viewpoint."}
